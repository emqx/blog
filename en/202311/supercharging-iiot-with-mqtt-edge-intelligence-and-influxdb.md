   Next, you can click the "SQL Test" button, fill in the following data:

   - Topic: emqx/test
   - Payload:

   ```
   {
   "location": "Prague",
   "temp": 26,
   "hum": 46.4
   }
   ```

   Click "SQL Test" and check the data output. If the settings are correct, the test output should display the complete JSON data.

   ![Click "SQL Test](https://assets.emqx.com/images/3427b77af9cb833bc8857c6946d0b4d4.png)

1. **Create an Action**

   Click "Next" and on the new action page, the default action type is "Save Data to InfluxDB." Select the resource you created earlier.

   For this case, you can fill out this part as follows:

   - Measurement can be set arbitrarily; here, we use "temp_hum."
   - Field Keys are filled with the two data points we want to record: "temp" and "hum."
   - Tag Keys are set to "location."
   - Timestamp Key is left blank by default.

   ![Create an Action](https://assets.emqx.com/images/dca45f76f92356095909a00b3cd80bb2.png)

   After confirming that the information is correct, click "Confirm" in the lower right corner to complete the data integration configuration. Through these steps, you can successfully configure InfluxDB integration, transform MQTT data into a format suitable for a time series database, and verify the correct transmission and storage of data. This allows you to easily analyze and query time series data.
