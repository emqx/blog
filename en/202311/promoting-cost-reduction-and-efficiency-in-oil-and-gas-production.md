### Real-time Industrial Data Acquisition

The industrial protocol gateway software, NeuronEX, supports various bus and industrial protocols, such as [Modbus](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/modbus-protocol-the-grandfather-of-iot-communication), [OPC UA](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/opc-ua-protocol), Siemens, ABB, Mitsubishi, and Schneider. It collects real-time data from devices in production sites and then converts them into standard [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) messages, with data points adhering to unified formatting standards and millisecond-level timestamps. NeuronEX also caches data offline to ensure the integrity of historical data during network interruptions.

NeuronEX’s rule engine enables real-time computation and analysis, message standardization, data filtering, intelligent alarms, business routing, data persistence, and more at the edge. This allows oil and gas producers to preprocess data and process event logic at the edge. 

NeuronEX’s HTTP PULL feature allows the perception of the configuration status and operating data of intelligent IT devices at the production field.

Moreover, NeuronEX can integrate AI  for intelligent video monitoring, safety management, equipment maintenance, fault prediction, inspection, and safety monitoring through real-time processing of IoT data and video streams.

### Enterprise-Grade IoT Message Bus

EMQX Enterprise deployed in the plant-level information center or group cloud provides a unified platform for oil and gas production data on private networks or the internet. This achieves high availability, high concurrency, and low-latency data transmission, analysis, processing, and integration. EMQX Enterprise MQTT platform can simultaneously handle connections from over a million IoT devices and process over a hundred thousand data interactions per second. It is highly suitable for the oil and gas production environment.

## What You Can Achieve with EMQ

### Comprehensive Perception and Centralized Management

EMQ’s solution facilitates data collection and management from intricate production equipment in oil and gas production, as well as safety and monitoring devices in the field. The cloud-edge collaborative architecture and data aggregation capabilities can address the challenge of centralizing the management of data from originally independent and scattered systems.

### Cost Reduction and Efficiency Improvement

The solution simplifies the complex maintenance tasks involved in oil and gas production through the unified intelligent management of equipment access, inspections, configurations, upgrades, updates, and alarm handling. This significantly reduces costs caused by manual operation and improves efficiency.

### Scalability and Flexibility for Future Innovation

The solution provides expandable interfaces to facilitate the integration of new systems and technologies into the business platform. At the edge, it supports the integration of algorithms in MATLAB, C, C++, Python, GO, and AI, promoting innovative development in edge intelligence.

Standardized configurations speed up IoT platform construction, making it easier to replicant and scale as the business grows.

The entire solution can be deployed through containerization, supporting cloud-native architecture to achieve unified container orchestration and management. This promotes the integration and innovation of smart oil and gas systems with cloud-native technologies.
