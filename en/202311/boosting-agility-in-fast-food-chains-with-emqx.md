It’s hard work to run a restaurant, especially a thousand of them. Even with the benefits of fast-evolving digital technologies – like self-service counters, mobile apps, handheld barcode scanners, smart sensors, and edge servers, most modern fast-food restaurant chains are challenged in taking advantage of them well to engage more customers from multiple channels. This is why a reliable solution to seamlessly bridge communication between restaurants and back offices is essential.

EMQ's solution offers a convenient way for merchants to manage orders that are scattered across various channels. With the ability to monitor and maintain equipment in real-time, the solution can help reduce order delays. This, in turn, can help them to attract customers from all possible channels with a better dining experience.

## Key Operational Challenges in Fast Food Restaurant Chains

### Selling on All Channels

Customers can place orders through various channels, including the counter, self-service kiosks, or their mobile phones. Although these transactions occur on different terminals, they share the same inventory. To provide the best user experience and prevent overselling, it is necessary to connect all sales channels to the centralized order system. Additionally, real-time processing and response must be ensured to guarantee prompt service.

### Manage Inventory Effectively

To effectively manage inventory, it is important to maintain a high turnover rate. This means products must sell quickly to minimize waste or spoilage. To achieve this, inventory levels must be closely monitored and sent to staff to help them adjust ordering and production plans.

### Minimize the Business Downtime

To minimize business downtime, it is crucial for fast-food restaurants to monitor and maintain equipment such as ovens, fryers, fridges, etc. Regular maintenance and repair work must be carried out to prevent equipment failure, which could lead to delays and frustrated customers.

By using IoT sensors, restaurants can now monitor equipment in real time. However, it is also important to extract alarm information from the monitoring data and promptly synchronize it with staff to ensure timely repairs of equipment malfunctions.

Thanks to EMQX's high scalability, you can easily deploy the EMQX MQTT broker in the back-office data center and on tens of thousands of restaurant edge servers. EMQX is adaptive for resources-constraint system environments.

The EMQX MQTT broker is an essential component for below key business systems across the edge servers and the data center:

- **Order Management**: EMQX is responsible for processing user orders at self-service kiosks and sending them to the order management system at the data center. Meanwhile, EMQX will receive incoming orders from Mobile apps and 3rd-party channels and route them to the restaurants.
- **Inventory Management**: EMQX processes inventory information updated by staff on handheld devices and synchronizes this information to the back office.
- **Equipment Management**: EMQX collects and processes the equipment health information collected by IoT sensors and synchronizes this information to the back office.

All terminal devices and edge server boxes are connected through the EMQX broker, which supports multiple protocols, operating systems, and QoS. The edge servers perform basic calculations and processing on requests from customers or staff and connect to the back office through the EMQX broker.

EMQX also supports connection encryption and authentication, ensuring you can switch flexibly between VPN connections and public network environment connections.
