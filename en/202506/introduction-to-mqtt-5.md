[MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt), which stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. It is particularly useful for remote connections where a small code footprint is required or network bandwidth is limited.

MQTT 5.0 is the latest version of the protocol, offering many improvements over its predecessors. New features include reason codes, session expiry intervals, topic aliases, user properties, subscription options, request/response feature, and [shared subscriptions](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introduction-to-mqtt5-protocol-shared-subscription). Weâ€™ll explore these new features, explain how popular brokers and client SDKs are supporting MQTT 5.0, and some key considerations when migrating from MQTT 3.1.1 to MQTT 5.0.

## Brief History and Evolution of MQTT 5.0

MQTT was first developed in the late 1990s by Dr. Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM and Arlen Nipper of Arcom (now Eurotech), to monitor oil pipelines over satellite networks. The initial version, MQTT v3.1, was designed to be lightweight and easy to implement, making it suitable for many IoT devices.

MQTT 3.1.1, an OASIS standard, was released in 2014, which included minor changes to the protocol to improve its clarity and interoperability. Its simplicity and efficiency in delivering messages over networks with limited resources led to its widespread adoption in IoT applications.

However, as the IoT industry evolved, so did the needs of its applications. This led to the development of MQTT 5.0, released in 2019, which introduced new features to address these changing needs. With its enhanced features, MQTT 5.0 is better equipped to handle the complex requirements of modern IoT applications.

## 7 New Features in MQTT v5

### 1. Reason Codes: Understanding Disconnections or Failures

Unlike its predecessors, MQTT 5.0 can provide a reason code for every acknowledgement packet, giving us a better understanding of why a disconnection or failure occurred.

This improvement aids in troubleshooting and allows for more precise error handling. For instance, if a client fails to connect to the server, the server will return a reason code explaining why the connection was unsuccessful. This could be due to a range of issues, from incorrect login credentials to a server being unavailable.

### 2. Session Expiry Intervals: Managing Session Lifetimes

This feature allows the client to specify how long the server should maintain its session after the client disconnects. In previous MQTT versions, a session either ended immediately upon disconnection or continued indefinitely. With MQTT 5.0, you can define a specific time period for which the session should be kept alive after disconnection. This provides greater flexibility in managing session lifetimes and conserves resources on the server.

### 3. Topic Aliases: Reducing Overhead in Message Headers

MQTT 5.0 introduces topic aliases to reduce the overhead in message headers. In previous versions, the topic name needed to be included in every message, leading to larger packet sizes.

With topic aliases, a short numeric alias can be assigned to a topic. This alias can be used in place of the full topic name in subsequent messages, significantly reducing the size of the MQTT header and conserving network bandwidth.

> Learn more in our detailed guide to [MQTT Topic Aliases](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-topic-alias).

### 4. User Properties: Custom Metadata in MQTT Headers

This feature allows users to include custom metadata in the headers of MQTT packets. This can be particularly useful for applications that need to send additional information with their MQTT messages, such as the message's timestamp, device location, or other application-specific data User properties provide greater flexibility and control over MQTT messaging.

> Learn more in our detailed guide to [MQTT User Properties](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-user-properties).

### 5. Subscription Options: Granular Subscription Controls

MQTT 5.0 allows clients to specify how they want to receive messages for each subscribed topic. For instance, clients can now specify whether they want to receive retained messages for a particular subscription, or whether they want to receive messages even if they have the same QoS (Quality of Service) level as the subscription.

> Learn more in our detailed guide to [MQTT Subscription Options](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/an-introduction-to-subscription-options-in-mqtt).

### 6. Request/Response: Allowing Clients to Reply to a Specified Topic

The request/response feature allows a client to specify a topic that the server can use to send a direct reply.

In earlier versions of MQTT, if a client wanted to send a response to a message, it had to publish the response to a topic, and the original sender had to be subscribed to that topic to receive the response. With MQTT 5.0's request/response feature, communication between clients and servers becomes much more efficient and straightforward.

> Learn more in our detailed guide to [MQTT Request/Response](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-request-response).

### 7. Shared Subscription: Load-Balancing Function for Subscribers

This feature allows multiple clients to share a subscription. When a message is published to a shared topic, the server distributes the message to one of the clients in the shared subscription, effectively load balancing the messages.

This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where you have multiple instances of a service running, and you want to distribute the workload evenly among them.
