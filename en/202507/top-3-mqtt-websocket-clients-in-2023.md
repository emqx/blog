## Introduction

**[MQTT over WebSocket](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/connect-to-mqtt-broker-with-websocket)** is a powerful combination for building real-time applications, especially for the Internet of Things (IoT). To debug and develop these applications efficiently, having the right **MQTT WebSocket client** is essential.

This blog post will explore the top 3 MQTT WebSocket client tools highly recommended in 2025.

## **Using a Free MQTT Broker for Testing**

Before diving into the client tools, you need an **[MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison)** that supports WebSocket to communicate and test with. A **free MQTT broker** is an ideal starting point for developers.

You can use the **free public MQTT broker** provided by EMQX at `broker.emqx.io`. This service is perfect for learning and testing, offering a public endpoint without any setup.

>**MQTT Broker Info**
>
>- Server: broker.emqx.io
>- TCP Port: 1883
>- WebSocket Port: 8083
>- SSL/TLS Port: 8883
>- Secure WebSocket  Port: 8084

**[EMQX Cloud Serverless](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud/serverless-mqtt)** also provides a **forever free MQTT broker** with a generous free quota of 1 million session minutes per month. It's an excellent option for prototyping and small projects, as it offers a managed, scalable service without the hassle of self-hosting.


## 1. MQTT.js

MQTT.js is an MQTT client library written in JavaScript and designed to run in both node.js and browser environments. It fully supports MQTT protocol versions 3.1.1 and 5.0, as well as TCP, TLS, and WebSocket transports.

MQTT.js is a simple and lightweight library that allows developers to easily connect to MQTT brokers and publish/subscribe to MQTT topics via WebSockets.

Additionally, MQTT.js provides good documentation and community support, making it easy for developers to get started and resolve any issues they may encounter.

GitHub Project: [https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/) 

### Features

- MQTT v3.1.1 and v5.0 support
- TCP, TLS/SSL, and WebSocket support
- Automatic topic alias
- Auto reconnection
- Messages buffer

### Installation

```shell
npm install mqtt -g
```

### Usage Example

Here is an example of connecting to the free public broker via MQTT over WebSocket, subscribing to an [MQTT topic](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/advanced-features-of-mqtt-topics), and sending and receiving messages.

```javascript
const mqtt = require('mqtt');

// MQTT broker configuration
const brokerUrl = 'ws://broker.emqx.io:8083/mqtt';
const options = {
  keepalive: 60,
  clientId: 'mqttjs_' + Math.random().toString(16).substring(2, 10),
  protocolId: 'MQTT',
  protocolVersion: 5,
  clean: true,
  reconnectPeriod: 1000,
  connectTimeout: 30 * 1000,
};

// Connect to MQTT broker
const client = mqtt.connect(brokerUrl, options);

// Handle connection success
client.on('connect', function () {
  console.log('Connected to MQTT broker successfully');
  
  // Subscribe to a topic
  const topic = 'test/topic';
  client.subscribe(topic, { qos: 1 }, function (err, granted) {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Failed to subscribe:', err);
      return;
    }
    console.log('Subscribed to topic:', granted[0].topic);
    
    // Publish a message after successful subscription
    const message = 'Hello MQTT over WebSocket!';
    client.publish(topic, message, { qos: 1 }, function (err) {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Failed to publish message:', err);
      } else {
        console.log('Message published:', message);
      }
    });
  });
});

// Handle incoming messages
client.on('message', function (topic, message, packet) {
  console.log('Received message:');
  console.log('Topic:', topic);
  console.log('Message:', message.toString());
  console.log('QoS:', packet.qos);
  
  // Gracefully disconnect after receiving message
  setTimeout(() => {
    client.end(false, () => {
      console.log('Disconnected from MQTT broker');
    });
  }, 1000);
});

// Handle connection errors
client.on('error', function (error) {
  console.error('Connection error:', error);
});

// Handle reconnection
client.on('reconnect', function () {
  console.log('Attempting to reconnect...');
});

// Handle connection close
client.on('close', function () {
  console.log('Connection closed');
});
```

## 2. MQTTX Web

[MQTTX Web](https://mqttx.app/web) is a user-friendly, browser-based tool for online debugging, developing, and testing MQTT applications. It connects to an MQTT broker via a WebSocket client and offers an intuitive interface.

## 3. Paho JavaScript Client

The Paho JavaScript Client is an MQTT browser-based client library written in Javascript that uses WebSockets to connect to an MQTT Broker.

Paho MQTT is an open-source MQTT client that implements MQTT 3.1.1, developed by the Eclipse Foundation. However, the project has not been actively maintained and has had few updates in recent years.

**Official Website:** [https://www.eclipse.org/paho/index.php?page=clients/js/index.php](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/index.php?page=clients/js/index.php) 

**GitHub Project:** [https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript) 

Features:

- MQTT 3.1.1 and WebSocket support
- SSL / TLS support
- Message Persistence
- Automatic Reconnect

### Usage Example

Please check out the project [README](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript) for examples of usage.

## Wrap up

For debugging and testing, MQTTX Web is an excellent, no-install option. For building web applications, MQTT.js stands out as the most robust and actively maintained MQTT WebSocket client library. While the Paho JavaScript Client is a viable choice, its less frequent updates make it less ideal for new projects.

Ultimately, your choice of client tool or library depends on your specific needs—whether you're prototyping, debugging, or building a full-scale web application. By leveraging a free MQTT broker like EMQX, you can get your projects off the ground quickly and cost-effectively, empowering you to focus on what matters most: building great IoT applications.
