## Introduction

In the world of **Internet of Things (IoT)**, seamless and reliable communication between devices is a necessity. The **[MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison)** acts as the central hub for this communication, routing messages between thousands, or even millions, of connected devices.

For developers and startups building IoT projects, finding a **free MQTT broker** is often a top priority. It allows you to develop, prototype, and test applications without the high costs associated with commercial solutions.

This guide explores the best **free MQTT broker** options available and provides a practical step-by-step walkthrough to help you choose and set up the right one for your project.

## Understanding Your Options for a Free MQTT Broker

When looking for a **free MQTT broker**, you'll typically encounter three main categories, each with its own advantages and limitations.

### 1. Open Source MQTT Broker

[Open source MQTT brokers](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/a-comprehensive-comparison-of-open-source-mqtt-brokers-in-2023) are software solutions that are freely available for developers to download, use, and modify according to their needs. 

**Popular Open Source MQTT Broker:**

- [EMQX](https://github.com/emqx/emqx): A highly scalable, masterless clustering MQTT broker with a large community and extensive feature set. It’s widely used for mission-critical applications in sectors like Industrial IoT, connected vehicles, and telecommunications.
- [Mosquitto](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mosquitto-mqtt-broker-pros-cons-tutorial-and-modern-alternatives): An excellent option for resource-constrained environments, known for its lightweight footprint. It supports the [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) versions 3.1, 3.1.1, and 5.0, providing flexibility and compatibility with a wide range of [MQTT clients](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-client-tools) and devices. 
- [NanoMQ](https://nanomq.io/): A lightweight and fast MQTT messaging broker designed for edge computing scenarios in IoT. It is lightweight and high-performance, making it suitable for various edge computing platforms.

**Key Considerations for Open Source MQTT Brokers:**

- **Self-Management:** You are responsible for all aspects of management, including updates, security, and scalability.
- **Learning Curve:** A steeper learning curve may be required to customize and maintain the broker.
- **Limited Support:** While communities provide support, it may not match the level of dedicated support offered by commercial solutions.

### 2. Public MQTT Broker

Public brokers are hosted services provided by companies, giving you a quick way to test and prototype without managing your own server. They offer convenience but come with their own set of trade-offs.

EMQX and Mosquitto both provide [public MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) services, allowing developers to connect their devices and applications to a reliable MQTT broker without the hassle of setting up their own infrastructure. The EMQX public broker offers scalability, high availability, and security features, making it a popular choice among IoT developers for prototyping and testing.

**Key Considerations for Public MQTT Brokers:**

- **Dependency on Service Provider:** Your application's uptime is tied to the service provider's reliability.
- **Limited Customization:** While public brokers offer essential features, customization options may be limited compared to self-hosted or open source solutions.
- **Data Privacy Concerns:** Always be mindful of security and data privacy when using public brokers for sensitive applications.

### Billing Model of EMQX Serverless

EMQX Serverless employs a pay-as-you-go billing model, based on three key components: session minutes, traffic (bandwidth), and rule actions.

- Session Minutes: Calculated per session initiated within a minute or part thereof.
- Traffic (Bandwidth): Encompasses both inbound and outbound messages processed by the deployment.
- Rule Actions: Pertains to the total number of actions performed within Data Integration.

## How to Get a Forever Free MQTT Broker: Free Quota and Spend Limit

### Free Quota

EMQX Serverless includes a substantial monthly free quota. As long as your usage stays within this quota, your **MQTT broker** remains completely free.

| **Billing Unit** | **Free Quota**                    | **Pricing**                       |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Session minute   | 1 million session minutes / month | $2.00 per million session minutes |
| Traffic          | 1 GB / month                      | $0.15 / GB                        |
| Rule action      | 1 million rule actions            | $0.25 per million rule actions    |

By setting the Spend Limit to 0 and utilizing the free quota, you can streamline your operations without any initial costs and without the need for a credit card.

To clarify what 1 million session minutes and 1 GB of traffic mean: 

A single MQTT client connected for a month uses about 43,200 session minutes, so 1 million minutes could support around 23 clients. With an average message size of 500 bytes, approximately 2,147,483 messages can be sent and received in a month. This allows each of the 23 clients to send and receive about 130 messages per hour continuously, indicating that the free quota is suitable for small-scale IoT scenarios.

### Spend Limit

The Spend Limit feature is your safeguard against unexpected costs. 

The Spend Limit is adjustable from 0 to 10,000:

- Set to 0: Your deployment will only use the free quota. Once the quota is depleted, the service simply pauses, ensuring you never incur any charges.
- Set between 1 and 10,000: Offers the flexibility to either pause the deployment or receive an alert when the monthly limit is reached.

You can obtain an MQTT broker forever free with the value set to zero. And if you are willing to pay for the extra session minutes or traffic, you don’t have to worry about overspending by setting a Spend Limit.
