We are excited to announce the expansion of the EMQX Platform into three new regions: AWS UAE (Middle East), AWS Central (Mexico), and Azure Canada Central. By extending our Dedicated service to these strategic locations, we bring our robust MQTT messaging capabilities closer to businesses, ensuring compliance, performance, and reliability for diverse industries.

## Driving Global IoT Innovation with Expanded Coverage

In today’s interconnected world, IoT deployments demand global accessibility and localized performance. The EMQX Platform’s expansion into these new regions addresses the evolving needs of businesses by providing low-latency communication, enhanced availability, and compliance with regional data regulations. Whether operating in the Middle East or North America, our customers can now deploy IoT infrastructure closer to their devices, enabling real-time data exchange and supporting mission-critical applications.

## AWS UAE (Middle East)

The AWS UAE region, strategically located in the Middle East, addresses critical data sovereignty and localization requirements. Many Middle Eastern countries, particularly the UAE, enforce strict regulations on data residency to ensure compliance with local laws. By hosting data in the AWS UAE region, businesses can meet these mandates, avoiding legal and operational risks associated with cross-border data transfers.
