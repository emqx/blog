[MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) is a lightweight and flexible protocol for exchanging IoT messages and delivering data. It is used to achieve a balance between flexibility and hardware/internet resources for IoT developers.

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a programming language developed by  JetBrains. Kotlin is based on the JVM, so developers can easily use it for Android development, and it supports mixed writing of Kotlin and Java.

This article mainly introduce that how to use Kotlin in the Android platform for using MQTT.

### Create the Kotlin project

Open Android Studio, create a new project, selecte Kotlin as the language, and then Android Studio will automatically create the related configurations to Kotlin. If you need to configure the existing projects, can refer to [Add Kotlin to an existing app](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/add-kotlin).

### Add dependency

Open `build.gradle` of the project, add dependencies [Eclipse Paho Java Client](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/java/) and [Eclipse Paho Android Service](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/android/) to the section `dependencies`.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3:1.2.4'
    implementation 'org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.android.service:1.1.1' 
}
```

### Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`

Android Service is a backend service, which based on Android and developed by Eclipse. We need to register it to the file AndroidManifest.xml. Meanwhile, we also need to register the permission.  

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

<application
   ...
   <service android:name="org.eclipse.paho.android.service.MqttService" />
</application>

```

### Create MQTT client

```kotlin
private lateinit var mqttClient: MqttAndroidClient
// TAG
companion object {
    const val TAG = "AndroidMqttClient"
}
```

### Connect MQTT broker

This article will use the [MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) which is operated and maintained by EMQX [MQTT Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud). EMQX Cloud is the MQTT IoT cloud service platform released by [EMQ](https://www.emqx.com/en), it provides the service for accessing **MQTT 5.0** with all-in-one operation and maintenance and unique isolation environment.

- Broker: **broker.emqx.io**
- TCP Port: **1883**
- Websocket Port: **8083**

```kotlin
fun connect(context: Context) {
        val serverURI = "tcp://broker.emqx.io:1883"
        mqttClient = MqttAndroidClient(context, serverURI, "kotlin_client")
        mqttClient.setCallback(object : MqttCallback {
            override fun messageArrived(topic: String?, message: MqttMessage?) {
                Log.d(TAG, "Receive message: ${message.toString()} from topic: $topic")
            }

            override fun connectionLost(cause: Throwable?) {
                Log.d(TAG, "Connection lost ${cause.toString()}")
            }

            override fun deliveryComplete(token: IMqttDeliveryToken?) {

            }
        })
        val options = MqttConnectOptions()
        try {
            mqttClient.connect(options, null, object : IMqttActionListener {
                override fun onSuccess(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Connection success")
                }

                override fun onFailure(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?, exception: Throwable?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Connection failure")
                }
            })
        } catch (e: MqttException) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }

    }
```

The interface `MqttCallback` includes three methods:

1. messageArrived: receive new messages from broker
2. connectionLost: lost the connection to broker
3. deliveryComplete: complete message delivery  to the broker

`MqttConnectOptions` is used to configure connection settings including users' password, timeout configuration, etc. Please view its function for details.

### Create MQTT subscription

Subscribe topic

```kotlin
fun subscribe(topic: String, qos: Int = 1) {
        try {
            mqttClient.subscribe(topic, qos, null, object : IMqttActionListener {
                override fun onSuccess(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Subscribed to $topic")
                }

                override fun onFailure(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?, exception: Throwable?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Failed to subscribe $topic")
                }
            })
        } catch (e: MqttException) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
    }
```

### Cancel subscription

Cancel subscribing topic

```kotlin
fun unsubscribe(topic: String) {
        try {
            mqttClient.unsubscribe(topic, null, object : IMqttActionListener {
                override fun onSuccess(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Unsubscribed to $topic")
                }

                override fun onFailure(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?, exception: Throwable?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Failed to unsubscribe $topic")
                }
            })
        } catch (e: MqttException) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
    }
```

### Publish messages

```kotlin
fun publish(topic: String, msg: String, qos: Int = 1, retained: Boolean = false) {
        try {
            val message = MqttMessage()
            message.payload = msg.toByteArray()
            message.qos = qos
            message.isRetained = retained
            mqttClient.publish(topic, message, null, object : IMqttActionListener {
                override fun onSuccess(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "$msg published to $topic")
                }

                override fun onFailure(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?, exception: Throwable?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Failed to publish $msg to $topic")
                }
            })
        } catch (e: MqttException) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
    }
```

###  Disconnect from the MQTT  Broker

```kotlin
fun disconnect() {
        try {
            mqttClient.disconnect(null, object : IMqttActionListener {
                override fun onSuccess(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Disconnected")
                }

                override fun onFailure(asyncActionToken: IMqttToken?, exception: Throwable?) {
                    Log.d(TAG, "Failed to disconnect")
                }
            })
        } catch (e: MqttException) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
    }
```

### Test

Firstly, you need to connect the Android client to the MQTT broker then subscribe topic: `a/b`, and then you can see the log of successfully connecting and subscribing.

![MQTT connect and subscribe](https://static.emqx.net/images/7711763b664ee9c6f0860b50bb0934c4.png)

We test with [MQTT 5.0 client tool - MQTT X](https://mqttx.app), publish messages to the topic: `a/b`, and then we can see the log of receiving messages on the client.

![MQTT 5.0 Client Tool  MQTT X](https://static.emqx.net/images/041917427b461f7d633faf3ff205b69d.png)

![receive MQTT messages](https://static.emqx.net/images/8451743b47f3e31fbb87377dcc0111d5.png)

We publish messages on the client to the topic: `a/b`. Because we subscribed to this topic, we will also receive the message at the same time. Finally, we disconnect the client from the MQTT broker. The log is as below: 

![publish mqtt message and disconnect](https://static.emqx.net/images/150e861f4c2375ab938adf4dd01e7ab6.png)

So far, we have finished the construction of MQTT client on the Android and implemented the connection between the client and MQTT broker, subscribing topics, messaging, etc.

MQTT can provide the real-time and reliable message service for connecting remote devices, only with a few code and limited bandwidth. Since it is a kind of low-cost, low-bandwidth occupancy instant communicating protocol, it is widely used for IoT, small size equipments, mobile applications, etc.

Kotlin is also a language promoted by Google, and we can develop more interesting applications by using the [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt) and [MQTT cloud service](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud).
