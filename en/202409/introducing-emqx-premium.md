We’re excited to announce the launch of our new **EMQX Platform Premium Plan**, designed specifically for mission-critical IoV, IoT, IIoT and AI applications in enterprises. This new offering represents a significant leap forward in our mission to provide rock-solid, scalable, and feature-rich MQTT messaging solutions for businesses operating on a global scale.

## The Evolution of EMQX Platform 

For years, businesses around the globe have trusted EMQX Platform for its reliable MQTT messaging capabilities. Our Serverless and Dedicated plans have powered a diverse range of applications, from small-scale projects like smart home lighting systems to massive deployments in industries such as automotive and oilfields. However, as IoT ecosystems and Gen AI applications grow more complex and data-intensive, we recognize the need for an even more powerful solution.

Today’s enterprises are managing unprecedented volumes of data and require a platform that not only handles these demands but excels in performance and reliability. The EMQX Platform Premium Plan is our answer to this challenge, empowering you to reach your most ambitious IoT and AI goals with confidence.

## Why Choose the Premium Plan?

The Premium Plan isn’t just an upgrade—it’s a leap forward. Here’s what it offers:

- **Dedicated Storage Layer:** With the Premium Plan, each deployment comes with its own isolated storage, ensuring maximum data security and performance. This dedicated storage layer supports multi-availability zones, providing high availability and redundancy. Automatic backups and easy restoration processes further enhance reliability, making it easier than ever to manage your data securely.
- **Durable Sessions:** Ensure uninterrupted connectivity for your IoT devices and AI data streams with durable sessions. This feature allows client sessions to persist even through server restarts, with automatic recovery of session states. It’s an essential capability for applications that experience intermittent connectivity, ensuring that your operations remain smooth and reliable.
- **Event History:** Gain deeper insights into your IoT ecosystem and AI data flow with comprehensive event history tracking. The Premium Plan records all client activities, including connect, disconnect, and message events. You can customize retention periods for historical data and utilize advanced search and filtering capabilities to analyze and monitor your IoT environment more effectively.
- **Cluster Linking (Coming Late September):** Expand your global reach with seamless cross-regional communication. The Cluster Linking feature enables automatic message routing between clusters across different geographical regions, enhancing both disaster recovery and high availability. Whether your operations span multiple regions or you need to ensure continuous service for your IoT and AI applications, Cluster Linking provides the reliability you need.
- **EMQX Streaming (Coming Late September):** Integrate your MQTT operations with Kafka ecosystems effortlessly. The Premium Plan offers native support for the Kafka protocol, allowing Kafka clients to consume MQTT messages directly. This integration simplifies your IoT and AI data pipelines, optimizing data flow and reducing the complexity of managing large-scale deployments.

## Is the Premium Plan Right for You?

The Premium Plan is tailored for:

- **Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV):** If you're managing fleets of connected vehicles or developing software-defined vehicle systems, the Premium Plan provides the scalability and reliability needed to handle massive data streams from hundreds of thousands of vehicles, ensuring seamless communication and real-time decision-making across vast geographical regions.
- **Global Enterprises:** If you’re running mission-critical IoT and AI applications that demand top-tier performance, reliability, and advanced features, this is for you.
- **Data-Intensive Applications:** Perfect for use cases generating large volumes of data—whether it’s powering real-time AI inference or conducting real-time analytics.
- **Multi-Region Deployments:** Ideal for businesses needing seamless communication and robust operations across multiple geographical regions.

## Premium Plan Pricing Model and Availability 

We've designed the Premium Plan pricing model to align with the value it delivers while offering flexibility to meet diverse enterprise needs. The pricing structure consists of two main components:

1. **Cluster Base Fee:** This annual subscription fee is based on the deployment size and specifications, reflecting the value of dedicated resources and advanced features.
2. **Usage-Based Traffic Fee:** Charged based on actual data transfer, this fee applies to both inbound and outbound network traffic, offering flexibility based on usage.

This two-part model ensures that you have access to premium features and dedicated resources while maintaining the flexibility to scale your costs with your usage. It's designed to provide a clear return on investment for businesses running mission-critical IoT and AI applications.
