## **Introduction**

**In the wave of global digitalization, the tourism and hospitality industries are undergoing profound transformations.** The application of technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence(AI) has not only changed the way people travel and dine but also significantly improved operational efficiency and service quality in these sectors. The tourism industry, through online booking systems and virtual tours, offers more convenient services to travelers, while the restaurant industry enhances customer experiences with digital menus and smart ordering systems.

**However, digital transformation also comes with challenges.** Many companies have yet to fully integrate technology with their business operations, and as a result, struggle to effectively apply digital tools in daily workflows. Additionally, poor internal data-sharing mechanisms often create isolated data silos, preventing businesses from unlocking the full potential of their data. The lack of professionals with digital skills further hampers the transformation process.

To stand out in the highly competitive global tourism and hospitality markets, businesses must leverage data to enhance operational efficiency. By doing so, they can gain deeper insights into customer needs, streamline business processes, improve service quality, and ultimately, enhance the overall customer experience.

## **EMQX in Restaurant Digital Ecosystem**

The restaurant digital ecosystem refers to the integration of a range of standardized and scalable hardware, software, digital devices, and services into a system that comprehensively covers all operational aspects of a restaurant. By leveraging big data analytics, this system maximizes the value of data, enabling restaurants to achieve full-scale upgrades from customer interaction to supply chain management. It enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, increases revenue, and improves customer experience and loyalty.

**Challenges:**

- The diversity of digital products in the restaurant industry often results in systems from different vendors that cannot be integrated, making it difficult to unify data across the ecosystem.
- The lack of standardized data interfaces and formats complicates cross-system data exchange.
- A stable and reliable system is required to handle massive data processing needs while ensuring customer data security.

**Use Case:**

An Indian restaurant tech company provides one-stop digital solutions for restaurants. By leveraging the flexible data processing and multi-protocol access capabilities of the EMQX Platform, the company built a comprehensive restaurant data management platform that integrates features such as digital menus, smart inventory, and digital marketing. The unified data channels provided by the EMQX Platform enable restaurants to seamlessly integrate large volumes of data from various operational systems, including order management, inventory control, and payment processing. This facilitates real-time inventory monitoring and intelligent restocking based on customer behavior, sales trends, and operational efficiency, helping restaurant businesses make smart decisions and further enhance customer satisfaction.

## **EMQX in Smart Restaurant Cloud Management System**

As consumers' expectations for service quality and experience in the restaurant industry continue to rise, traditional restaurant management models are struggling to meet the growing market demand. Managing restaurant data in the cloud not only reduces labor costs through automated processes and improves order processing speed and service quality, but also offers customers convenient features like online reservations, ordering, and payment, enhancing customer interaction.

**Challenges:**

Traditional POS systems are difficult to integrate with other hotel management systems, leading to isolated, in-house systems with high operational costs and the creation of data silos.

**Use Case:**

A cloud-based restaurant management solution provider leveraged the EMQX Platform’s scalability and large-scale data processing capabilities to develop a smart restaurant cloud management system. This system allows restaurant owners to access business data and monitor operations anytime, anywhere, helping to optimize restaurant configurations, improve service processes, minimize human error and resource waste, and ultimately maximize profitability. With EMQX's support, the company delivers highly customized services for its clients, enabling efficient data migration to the cloud and unified management.

## EMQX in **Hotel Operations Management Platform**

The hotel operations management platform is an integrated software solution that optimizes daily hotel operations through automation and intelligent technologies. It covers various aspects such as data analysis, housekeeping management, customer service, asset management, predictive maintenance, and cost and budget control, effectively enhancing operational efficiency, reducing management costs, improving customer experience, and supporting more precise market strategy development.

**Challenges:**

- Hotels often use multiple standalone systems, such as POS and CRM systems, leading to data silos that hinder effective data integration and interaction.
- Managing large volumes of customer data, including personal information, accommodation records, and payment details, places high demands on data collection and processing capabilities.
- The hotel industry generally lacks strong data management and analysis capabilities, making it difficult to extract valuable insights from massive datasets.

**Use Case:**

An American hotel operations technology company utilized EMQX's large-scale data collection and processing capabilities to closely integrate multiple modules into a unified hotel operations management platform. This platform provides hotels with more efficient and intuitive management tools. By seamlessly integrating and accessing data, the company developed systems for smart rooms and employee management, allowing for room temperature, lighting, and entertainment settings to be adjusted based on guest preferences. It also provides hotel staff with accurate information on clock-out status, room conditions, and location, helping improve customer service levels and operational efficiency.

## EMQX in **Cruise Data Management and Applications**

As people expect more from their travel experiences, it's important for cruise lines to manage data efficiently. By gathering information about passengers' booking habits, spending preferences, and service feedback, cruise lines can better understand what passengers need and offer personalized services and products. Efficient data management also helps cruise lines allocate resources effectively, improve service quality, and lower operational costs. Additionally, by analyzing voyage data and passenger health information, cruise lines can identify potential risks early, take preventive measures, and ensure safe sailing.

**Challenges:**

- Cruise companies must manage vast amounts of passenger information, booking data, financial records, and health and safety information, often spread across different systems, making integration and utilization difficult.
- As data volumes increase, ensuring data security, compliance, and availability has become a critical operational concern for these companies.

**Use Case:**

An American cruise line faced challenges in efficiently managing large volumes of passenger data. EMQX provided high-throughput messaging capability, enabling real-time processing of data streams from various onboard devices and enhancing monitoring capabilities. For mobile applications, EMQX supports low-latency, high-concurrency data collection and unified uploads, allowing passengers to easily book onboard activities, view personal itineraries, and receive instant notifications, leading to a more personalized service experience.
