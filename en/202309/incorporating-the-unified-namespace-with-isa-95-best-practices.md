[ISA-95](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/exploring-isa95-standards-in-manufacturing), also known as the "Enterprise-Control System Integration" standard, provides a framework for integrating enterprise and control systems in manufacturing and production environments. Incorporating a [Unified Namespace](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/unified-namespace-next-generation-data-fabric-for-iiot) with the ISA-95 standard involves adhering to best practices that are consistent with the principles and guidelines of ISA-95. 

This blog will guide you on incorporating a Unified Namespace with ISA-95 with some best practices. We will use [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) as an [MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison) and [Neuron](https://neugates.io/) as an Industrial Connectivity Gateway.

## Replacing ISA-95 Layer Models with Unified Namespace Architecture

The traditional ISA-95 standard uses layer models to categorize different levels of operation, from the enterprise to the control system. However, the Unified Namespace concept proposes to move away from these discrete layers and instead advocates a cohesive and interconnected framework where all components and data are organized under a single, unified naming convention, facilitated by Neuron's data acquisition capabilities and EMQX's dynamic topic-based structure.

This approach seeks to break down silos and enhance interoperability by treating all components, whether IT or OT, as part of a unified system. Neuron's ability to bridge different industrial protocols and standards ensures that diverse devices and sensors can communicate seamlessly through EMQX's MQTT-based approach. Replacing ISA-95 Layer Models with a Unified Namespace through the integration of EMQX and Neuron offers a modernized way of managing industrial operations.

## Integrating ISA-95 Naming Convention Model into Unified Namespace

By applying the ISA-95 naming convention, equipment, processes, and resources are labeled consistently, improving clarity and communication across the unified namespace. The equipment model hierarchy, which typically includes levels such as enterprise, site, area, unit, and control module, provides a logical structure for organizing these components within the unified namespace, which is structured in the EMQX broker as a central data repository.

This integration seeks to leverage the strengths of both approaches: the ISA-95 framework provides a systematic way to structure equipment and processes, while the unified namespace promotes flexibility, data sharing, and cross-functional collaboration. Successful implementation of this approach requires careful consideration of naming conventions, ensuring compatibility with existing systems, and resolving potential conflicts between standardized hierarchy and the desire for seamless connectivity.

## Utilizing the EMQX ACL Mechanisms for Unified Namespace Security

EMQX's Access Control Lists (ACLs) for topic access within the Unified Namespace provide a robust security mechanism tailored for industrial environments. By allowing administrators to fine-tune data access on a per-topic basis, ACLs enhance security, confidentiality, and data integrity. This alignment with the principles of Role-Based Access Control streamlines permissions management, granting authorized individuals or groups precise levels of access while preventing unauthorized data exposure or manipulation.

In addition, the integration of EMQX's ACLs seamlessly supports the Unified Namespace concept by ensuring that only relevant individuals have access to specific [MQTT topics](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/advanced-features-of-mqtt-topics). This controlled access enhances privacy, facilitates regulatory compliance, and enables detailed audit trails. As industrial operations scale, ACLs maintain efficiency by adapting to changing roles and responsibilities, contributing to a secure and organized environment that meets the needs of modern industry.

## Supporting the Data Consistency with Gobal Standard Industrial Protocols 

Neuron's support for some mainstream standard industrial protocols such as "[MQTT Sparkplug](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-sparkplug-bridging-it-and-ot-in-industry-4-0)" and "[OPC UA over MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/opc-ua-over-mqtt-the-future-of-it-and-ot-convergence)" plays a pivotal role in ensuring data consistency within the Unified Namespace framework. These protocols facilitate seamless communication and data exchange between industrial devices, Neuron Industrial Connectivity Gateway, and the EMQX MQTT broker. The integration of these protocols enhances the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of data sharing across the entire industrial ecosystem.

Major technology giants like AWS, Azure, Siemens, Beckhoff, and others strongly endorse these technologies for [industrial IoT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/iiot-explained-examples-technologies-benefits-and-challenges) and automation. MQTT Sparkplug streamlines data communication for real-time exchanges in industrial and IoT settings, with major tech players offering robust support through MQTT broker services. Meanwhile, the fusion of OPC UA and [MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt), OPC UA over MQTT, ensures secure and efficient data transfer in industrial applications backed by implementations from these leaders. This backing highlights the pivotal role of these protocols in modernizing industrial processes, fostering data-driven decisions, and driving innovation.

## Synchronizing Multi-Site Across Disparate Manufacturing Processes 

Leveraging EMQX's high-speed data replication capabilities to establish multi-site synchronization and create a Unified Namespace offers a multitude of benefits.
