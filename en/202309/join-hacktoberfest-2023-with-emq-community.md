Hacktoberfest, the annual event, is about to begin! We are thrilled to participate in the 10th annual Hacktoberfest with two projects - LF Edge eKuiper and NanoMQ. We invite developers from around the world to join us in this exciting event!

## About Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source hosted by DigitalOcean. It encourages developers to contribute to open-source projects and rewards them with digital swag kits. Participating in Hacktoberfest not only provides developers with the satisfaction of making a positive impact in the open source community but also allows them to receive recognition for their contributions.

## LF Edge eKuiper and NanoMQ

[LF Edge eKuiper](https://ekuiper.org/) is a lightweight IoT data analytics and stream processing engine running on resource-constraint edge devices. The major goal for eKuiper is to provide a streaming software framework on the edge side. The primary language of eKuiper is Golang.

[NanoMQ](https://nanomq.io/) is an open-source edge computing project released in Jan 2021 and it is the next generation of lightweight, high-performance MQTT messaging broker for the IoT edge computing scenario. The main development language for NanoMQ is C.
