## What Is AWS?

AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is the world’s leading cloud platform. It provides a mix of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS provides a variety of services that can be used as building blocks to run organizational workloads.

Running your applications in the AWS cloud can help you move faster and save substantial costs, benefiting from the scale and performance of AWS. AWS powers a wide variety of workloads including web and mobile applications, enterprise applications, data processing and warehousing, storage, and many others.

AWS is known for its wide range of features and capabilities. These include on-demand computing power, database storage, content delivery, and advanced analytics capabilities. It allows organizations to tap into a global infrastructure that can serve almost any computing requirement, on-demand and without having to deploy resources on-premises.

## What Is MQTT?

[MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt), or Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, is a simple and lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. The design principles of MQTT are to minimize network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery.

MQTT is often used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to its efficient use of network resources, its low power usage, and its minimized data packets. It is most useful in remote locations where a small code footprint is required, or where network bandwidth is at a premium.

The MQTT protocol works by exchanging a series of [MQTT control packets](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/Introduction-to-mqtt-control-packets) in a defined way. The client and server send each other packets to keep the connection alive, to publish data, to acknowledge receipt of data, and to adjust the quality of service (QoS) level of the connection. MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for lightweight M2M communications. It was originally developed by IBM in the late 1990s and has been used in a variety of IoT settings.

This is part of a series of articles about [IoT in the cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/iot-in-the-cloud-8-key-benefits-and-how-to-get-started).

## AWS IoT Core and MQTT

AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT Core fully supports MQTT, as well as HTTP and WebSockets. With AWS IoT Core, applications can keep track of and communicate with IoT devices, even when they aren’t currently connected.

The AWS IoT Core service allows for secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the AWS Cloud. This enables you to collect telemetry data from multiple devices, and store and analyze the data. You can also create applications that enable your users to control these devices from their phones or tablets.

For more information on the features and capabilities of AWS IoT Core, see the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/index.html).

## AWS MQTT Pricing

The cost of using AWS IoT Core is mainly determined by the number of messages published to AWS IoT and delivered to devices or applications. A message is a 512-byte block of data processed by AWS IoT. The total number of messages is the sum of all inbound and outbound messages.

The pricing for AWS IoT Core is based on the number of messages published to AWS IoT (message ingest) and delivered by AWS IoT to devices or applications (message delivery). You are billed separately for each. As of the time of writing, the first 250 million messages per month are charged at $1.00 per million messages, and the price decreases with increasing volume.

However, it's important to note that AWS offers a Free Tier for AWS IoT Core, which includes 250,000 free messages (published or delivered) per month for the first 12 months. After the first 12 months or above the free tier limit, standard AWS IoT Core pricing applies. For up-to-date pricing, refer to the [official pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/pricing/).

## Quick Tutorial: Using AWS IoT Core with MQTT

This brief guide will show you how to create your first 'thing' object in the AWS IoT ecosystem, connect a device to this object, and monitor the MQTT messages generated by the device. You’ll download software to the IoT device that runs an interactive tutorial, demonstrating the AWS IoT Core service.

**Please note:**

- If your device doesn't have a compatible browser, carry out this tutorial on a computer and transfer the downloaded files to your device.
- Your IoT device must be able to interact with port 8443 on your AWS account’s device data endpoint.

**To run the interactive tutorial on your IoT device:**

1. From the browser on your IoT device, sign in to AWS IoT Console and select **Connect** >  **Connect one device**.

2. Prepare your device according to the instructions and register a new 'thing' under the **Register and Secure Your Device** section. Choose a unique name for your 'thing' and provide additional configurations if needed. Note that a 'thing' name cannot be modified once created.

3. In the **Choose Platform and SDK** section, select your preferred platform and SDK language. For this tutorial, select the Python SDK on Linux/OS X platform.

4. AWS IoT now provides a connection kit including various critical files. Download it to your device. Unzip the file by running unzip connect_device_package.zip or an equivalent command.

5. Open up a terminal window on your device and follow the instructions in the AWS IoT Console. The console will provide a command to run in the directory containing the connection kit file.

6. After you enter the command, you should see an output in the device's terminal or command window that is similar to the following. This output is from the messages the program is sending to and then receiving back from AWS IoT Core.

   ![Output in the device's terminal](https://assets.emqx.com/images/57ad22c0066012ec3225443b8a088216.png)

7. While the sample program is running, the test message Hello World! will appear in the terminal on the device.

8. If you want to see messages from your IoT client in the AWS IoT console, from the **Test** page of the console, open the **MQTT test client**.

9. In the test client, use the **Topic** filter, and enter a topic such as sdk/test/python to subscribe to messages from your device. The topic filters are case sensitive.

10. After you subscribe to the test topic, run ./start.sh on your device. Messages should start to appear in the MQTT client, similar to the following. The number in square brackets should increase by one each time a new message is received.

   ```
   {
   
    "message": "Hello World!" [1]
   
   }
   ```

That’s it! You just registered a IoT device with AWS IoT Core and sent MQTT messages to AWS.
