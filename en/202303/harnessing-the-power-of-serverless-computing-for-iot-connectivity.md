We're thrilled to announce that the highly anticipated [EMQX Cloud Serverless](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud/serverless-mqtt) is almost here, with a launch date of April 1, 2023! As the latest addition to our fully managed MQTT service, we can't wait to share the benefits of this cutting-edge technology with our users.

By incorporating serverless technology, we have enhanced the flexibility and affordability of our messaging platform. It’s the perfect solution for small businesses, startups, and independent developers. With our MQTT over QUIC protocol, you can be assured that all messages are delivered securely and promptly.

EMQX Cloud Serverless empowers IoT developers to develop and test their projects more efficiently than ever before. You can get your MQTT services up and running in a mere 5 seconds.

If you're looking for a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective MQTT messaging platform, look no further than EMQX Cloud Serverless.

**MQTT Messaging is Faster, Easier, and Cheaper Than Ever.**


**Here’s what EMQX Cloud Serverless means for you:**

- **Faster time to market:** with our innovative serverless MQTT broker, you can now focus on creating IoT-driven business logic instead of worrying about managing infrastructure. This translates into faster time-to-market for your applications.
- **Significantly reduced costs:** Our large-scale, multi-tenant cluster eliminates the need for users to pay for idle resources, making it especially beneficial for IoT applications with unpredictable traffic patterns. With a free quota of 1 million session minutes and 1 GB of traffic per month, and the ability to enjoy up to 1000 sessions, you can start using EMQX Cloud Serverless at no cost. Our pay-as-you-go pricing ensures that you only pay for the amount of time and data you use each month, ensuring low IoT costs. See pricing [here](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/price/pricing.html).
- **High-performance auto-scaling architecture:** our serverless MQTT technology is intelligent and self-scaling, allowing you to respond seamlessly to fluctuating business demands. It can also improve reliability by automatically scaling resources and handling server failures.

**Never Overspend Again with Timely Reminders and Flexible Options**

With EMQX Cloud Serverless, you are always in charge of your spending. Starting from April 1, you can set your monthly spending limit between $1 - $10,000, and receive timely reminders as you approach your limit. Moreover, you can specify the action triggered when your consumption reaches the spending limit for the current month. You have the flexibility to either stop the deployment or continue billing according to your preferences.

- If you set the limit to $0, your Serverless deployment will only consume the free quota.
- If you set the spending limit greater than $0, you will need to provide a payment method.

Please note that even if the spending limit has not been reached, a serverless deployment will be stopped if there is an overdue bill.

> Starting from April 1, 2023, all users who have created a Serverless (Beta) deployment will be automatically converted to the general release, with the monthly spending limit for the deployment set to $0 by default. This means that Serverless deployments will not incur any additional charges until you modify the spending limit.
