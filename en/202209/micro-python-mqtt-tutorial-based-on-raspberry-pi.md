The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK, is an ARM-based microcomputer motherboard. It provides a USB interface and Ethernet interface to connect the keyboard, mouse and network cable. The motherboard has the basic functions of a PC, while Raspberry Pi has integrated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and many GPIOs, and is widely used in teaching, home entertainment, IoT, etc.

MicroPython is a complete software implementation of the Python 3 programming language, written in C and optimized for a full Python compiler and runtime system running on top of MCU (microcontroller unit) hardware, providing the user with an interactive prompt (REPL) to immediately execute the supported commands. In addition to selected core Python libraries, MicroPython includes modules that give programmers access to low-level hardware, and is a streamlined implementation of the Python 3 language that includes a small portion of the Python standard library optimized to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

[MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt) is a lightweight IoT messaging protocol based on a publish/subscribe model that provides real-time reliable messaging to connected devices with minimal code and bandwidth, making it suitable for devices with limited hardware resources and network environments with limited bandwidth. Therefore, the MQTT protocol is widely used in IoT, Mobile Internet, Smart Hardware, Telematics, Power, Energy and other industries.

In this article, we will discuss how to write a simple [MQTT client](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt-client-sdk) on Raspberry Pi using MicroPython, and implement the functions of connecting, subscribing and publishing between the client and [MQTT broker.](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker)


## Environment Setup

### Install MicroPython

   The Raspberry Pi OS used in this article is `Raspberry Pi OS with desktop
(Debian version: 10, 64-bit)`.

- When the OS used by the Raspberry Pi is based on `Debian version: 10 (buster)`, you can install MicroPython directly with the following command.

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   # Install MicroPython
   sudo apt-get -y install micropython
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > If you get an `E: Unable to locate package micropython` error during installation, you can use the `snap` or `build from source` to install.

- If your Raspberry Pi OS is based on `Debian version: 11 (bullseye)`, you can install MicroPython using snap.

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install snapd
   sudo reboot
   sudo snap install core
   sudo snap install micropython
   ```

- Install MicroPython from source.

   For more details, please refer to the Raspberry Pi documentation at [https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/gettingstarted.html](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/gettingstarted.html).


After the installation is complete, execute `micropython` in the terminal, and if MicroPython x.x.x (x means number) is returned, the installation is successful.

### Install the MQTT client library

In order to easily connect to the MQTT server, we need to install the `umqtt.simple` library.

```
micropython -m upip install umqtt.simple
```

   
## Connecting to The MQTT Broker

This article will use the [free public MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) provided by EMQ, which was created based on the [MQTT Cloud Service - EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud). The broker access information is as follows.

- Broker: `broker.emqx.io`
- TCP Port: `1883`
- Websocket Port: `8083`


## Subscribe

Open any editor, type the following code and save it as a sub.py file:

```
# sub.py
import time
from umqtt.simple import MQTTClient

SERVER="broker.emqx.io"
ClientID = f'raspberry-sub-{time.time_ns()}'
user = "emqx"
password = "public"
topic = "raspberry/mqtt"
msg = b'{"msg":"hello"}'

def sub(topic, msg):
    print('received message %s on topic %s' % (msg, topic))

def main(server=SERVER):
    client = MQTTClient(ClientID, server, 1883, user, password)
    client.set_callback(sub)
    client.connect()
    print('Connected to MQTT Broker "%s"' % (server))
    client.subscribe(topic)
    while True:
        if True:
            client.wait_msg()
        else:
            client.check_msg()
            time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


## Publish

Open any editor, type the following code, and save it as a pub.py file:

```
# pub.py
import time
from umqtt.simple import MQTTClient

server="broker.emqx.io"
ClientID = f'raspberry-pub-{time.time_ns()}'
user = "emqx"
password = "public"
topic = "raspberry/mqtt"
msg = b'{"msg":"hello"}'

def connect():
    print('Connected to MQTT Broker "%s"' % (server))
    client = MQTTClient(ClientID, server, 1883, user, password)
    client.connect()
    return client

def reconnect():
    print('Failed to connect to MQTT broker, Reconnecting...' % (server))
    time.sleep(5)
    client.reconnect()

try:
    client = connect()
except OSError as e:
    reconnect()

while True:
  print('send message %s on topic %s' % (msg, topic))
  client.publish(topic, msg, qos=0)
  time.sleep(1)
```

In the above codes, we call the publish() function to send a message to the topic raspberry/mqtt. The parameter QoS is another MQTT feature. To learn more about QoS, please see the [Introduction to MQTT QoS (Quality of Service)](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introduction-to-mqtt-qos). In this example we set it to 0.


## Testing

We use the [MQTT 5.0 client tool - MQTT X](https://mqttx.app/) to perform the following tests.

### Test subscribe

1. Open a terminal, run the MicroPython code, and listen for messages.

   ```
   micropython sub.py
   ```

   ![micropython sub](https://assets.emqx.com/images/5aceddabb0706609862ba8f6c8436c14.png)

2. Use the MQTT X client to connect with the MQTT server and send messages to the topic `raspberry/mqtt`.

   ![MQTT client tool](https://assets.emqx.com/images/8ebd27d6b93c80dd77a44571557e8bfe.png)

3. Check the Raspberry Pi terminal information and you will see that the MQTT X publish messages have been successfully received.

### Test publish

1. Subscribe to the `raspberry/mqtt` topic in the MQTT X client.

2. Run the MicroPython code in the terminal and publish the message.

   ```
   micropython pub.py
   ```

   ![Publish MQTT messages](https://assets.emqx.com/images/cdd350b4bb8e9506225f922de1e295dd.png)

3. In the MQTT X client, view the messages sent by the Raspberry Pi.

## Summary

This is a simple example of programming with MicroPython on a Raspberry Pi. We implemented a simple test client with MicroPython `umqtt.simple`, and completed the connection and message sending and receiving between the client and the MQTT server. The biggest advantage of MQTT is that it provides real-time reliable messaging services for connected remote devices with very little code and limited bandwidth, while the Raspberry Pi is a small, low heat, low energy, and relatively comprehensive hardware module. Combining the two can help you develop more innovative applications, even in microcontrollers or constrained environments.
