Dear Customers,

We wish to inform you that effective **March 30th, 2024**, the **EMQX Dedicated - Standard Plan** is no longer available. Rest assured, any deployments established before this date will **NOT** be affected, and will continue to receive our full support and maintenance. 

In May 2021, we introduced the Dedicated - Standard plan, offering fully managed MQTT services for single-node infrastructures. Since then, EMQX has broadened its product suite to include Serverless and BYOC plans. To refine our product development focus and enhance the quality of maintenance services, we have decided to cease the creation of Dedicated - Standard deployments after March 30, 2024.

Following these changes, the Dedicated - Professional plan will henceforth be known simply as Dedicated, offering an array of advanced features and superior performance suitable for all business sizes. Moreover, the Serverless deployment option continues to be available, already surpassing the Standard plan in both features and performance. We invite you to further explore and take advantage of our extensive product portfolio.

We thank you for your understanding and continued support!

Best Regards,

The EMQ Team
