## **Introduction to OPC Protocol**

OPC (Open Platform Communications) protocol is a key technical standard in the field of industrial automation for enabling communication between devices, control systems, and applications. It provides a universal data exchange method for devices and systems from different manufacturers, greatly enhancing the interoperability and efficiency of industrial control systems.

The OPC standard is divided into Classic and Unified Architecture:

- **OPC Classic** specification was born in 1996, based on Microsoft Windows technology, using COM/DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) to exchange data between software components. It includes sub-specifications such as OPC DA, OPC AE, OPC HAD, and OPC DX, each providing separate definitions for accessing process data, alarms, and historical data.
- **OPC Unified** Architecture (UA), the successor to OPC Classic, was released in 2006. It integrates all the functionalities of various OPC Classic sub-specifications into an extensible framework, independent of the platform and service-oriented. It no longer relies on COM implementation and is stronger in terms of security and scalability.

OPC UA and OPC DA differ significantly in several aspects like interoperability, security, functionality, performance, and compatibility. These variances can impact production and management expenses. This article will provide a comprehensive guide on OPC DA and OPC UA to help readers make wise choices based on specific industrial needs, thus reducing unnecessary costs effectively.

## **Unpacking OPC DA**

### What is OPC DA?

Before OPC technology emerged, there was no unified standard for interconnecting devices in the automation field. Different hardware manufacturers and software manufacturers use their own communication protocols, leading to protocol confusion and increased communication costs.

OPC Classic technology was born to facilitate interoperability between different software and hardware.

OPC DA (Data Access) is a protocol standard introduced earliest by the OPC Foundation, mainly used for accessing and exchanging real-time data. It is built on Microsoft's COM/DCOM technology, providing an industrial automation system with a standardized communication interface.

OPC DA supports reading, writing, subscribing, and unsubscribing real-time data. It adopts a client/server architecture, allowing multiple clients to access data on the server simultaneously.

It is widely used in manufacturing, process control, energy management, and other fields such as oil and gas, chemical, pharmaceutical, and power.

### Pros and Cons of OPC DA

Pros:

- Mature technology
- Wide application
- Ease of implementation and deployment

Cons:

- Dependency on the Windows platform
- Lack of security mechanisms
- Simple data model

## **Introducing OPC UA**

### What is OPC UA?

[OPC UA (Unified Architecture)](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/opc-ua-protocol) is a new generation protocol standard introduced by the OPC Foundation based on the lessons learned from OPC DA. It adopts a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and provides a platform-independent, secure, and scalable communication mechanism.

Compared to OPC DA, OPC UA introduces a richer data model with support for complex data types and semantic descriptions. It also provides built-in security mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, and encrypted transmission. In addition, OPC UA supports multiple transport protocols such as TCP, HTTPS, WebSocket, etc.

With its outstanding performance and flexibility, OPC UA has been widely used in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), smart manufacturing, remote equipment monitoring, and other fields. For example, in smart factories, OPC UA can achieve seamless data integration from shop floor equipment to upper-level systems such as MES, ERP, and more.

### Pros and Cons of OPC UA

Pros:

- Platform independence
- Strong security features
- A rich information model

Cons:

- The protocol is relatively complex, leading to higher development and implementation costs.
