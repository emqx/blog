[CloudMQTT](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/blog/end-of-life-announcement.html) offers managed Mosquitto servers in the cloud, providing various MQTT plans suitable for hobbyists and small-scale production deployments. However, with CloudMQTT's impending closure, users are seeking a migration plan to ensure uninterrupted MQTT services through a managed solution. While CloudMQTT suggests CloudAMQP as an alternative, it may not be the best fit for MQTT users due to differences in protocol design.

In contrast, the [EMQX Platform](https://www.emqx.com/en) stands out by offering users flexible plans that cater to their evolving needs. Built specifically for IoT applications, the EMQX Platform provides a seamless migration path for CloudMQTT users, emphasizing its rich features and adaptable plans. With EMQX, users can expect a robust and reliable MQTT solution tailored to their IoT messaging requirements, ensuring a smooth transition and long-term assurance.

## **Pre-Migration Essentials: Getting Ready for EMQX**

To smoothly transition your IoT deployment from CloudMQTT to the EMQX platform, please follow the migration plan outlined below:

1. **Evaluate Current Usage and Requirements**: Begin by assessing your CloudMQTT specifications and settings to help in selecting the appropriate EMQX platform plan.
2. **Select the Right EMQX Platform Plan**: The EMQX platform offers multiple plans:
   - **Serverless Plan**: Provides a secure and scalable MQTT service billed based on usage, with complete freedom within the free quota. Supports up to 1000 sessions.
   - **Dedicated Plan**: Deployed in an independent cloud environment, this MQTT cluster service supports advanced features such as real-time data processing, data persistence, message distribution, and VPC peering (private network). It is highly available and high-performance, making it the best choice for production environments.
   - **BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud)**: Seamlessly integrates the EMQX MQTT server with your existing systems, keeping your data secure in your cloud and managed with EMQ's expertise.

For more details, please refer to our [Product Plan](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/price/plans.html) documentation.

1. **Register and Configure Your EMQX Platform Account**: Register for an EMQ account and choose the plan that best suits your needs. Then, create a new deployment in the EMQX Platform console, which will serve as the central point for MQTT client connections. You can follow the step-by-step instructions in our [Creating a Deployment](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/create/overview.html) documentation.
2. **Migrate Your Custom Domain**: With the Dedicated Plan, you can seamlessly migrate your CloudMQTT deployment to the EMQX Platform without requiring clients to update their settings. This makes migration effortless. For detailed instructions on how to bind a domain name, please refer to our documentation on [How to Bind a Domain Name](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/faq/normal_b.html#how-to-bind-a-domain-name).
3. **Migrate Security and Authentication Settings**: On the EMQX platform, reconfigure your security settings to mirror those in CloudMQTT, including creating client credentials or certificates and configuring authorization rules.

- For Serverless Deployment, we provide default encrypted ports for connections (MQTTS and WSS).
- For the Dedicated Plan, we support custom TLS/SSL configurations, as detailed in our [TLS/SSL Configuration Documentation](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/deployments/tls_ssl.html).
- Additionally, for client authentication and authorization, we offer tutorials to guide you through the process as outlined in our [Client Authentication Documentation](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/deployments/auth_overview.html) and [Client Authorization Documentation](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/deployments/authz_overview.html).

1. **Update MQTT Client Configurations**: Adjust [MQTT clients](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-client-tools) to connect to the new EMQX Platform Deployment by updating the MQTT connection address, port, and authentication details. Ensure that all devices and applications acting as MQTT clients can connect to the new environment. If your devices were previously connected via a custom domain, you can directly point the domain to the connection address provided by the new EMQX Dedicated Plan, simplifying the client update process.
2. **Test and Validate Migration Configurations**: Before going live, thoroughly test your configurations to ensure client connectivity and communication are functioning correctly. We recommend using [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/) to simulate temperature and humidity data reporting, or any other MQTT client.
3. **Technical Support Assistance**: If you encounter any issues during the migration process, you can reach out to our technical support team by sending an email to cloud-support@emqx.io or by submitting a ticket. Our [Ticket Submission Guide](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/feature/tickets.html#tickets) provides detailed assistance.

## **See It in Action: Migrating to EMQX Made Simple**

**Add User & ACL Rule in CloudMQTT** 

![Add User & ACL Rule in CloudMQTT](https://assets.emqx.com/images/d2e63172de8e72f77d723908cf5bb46e.png)

**Username and Password Configuration**: For this example, we used test/test.

![Username and Password Configuration](https://assets.emqx.com/images/a716453718e7a8b391f5322fc4f8f337.png)

**Topic Subscription Permissions**: Since the Read permission for the wildcard topic `#` is set to false, the client using MQTTX cannot subscribe to all topics by default. However, with the Read permission for the topic `test` set to true, the client can subscribe to this specific topic. When connecting via client libraries, the connection URL should look like: **mqtt://user:password@server:port**.

**Synchronizing Configuration to EMQX Serverless Deployment**: In response to the connection test, we will synchronize the configuration to the EMQX Serverless deployment. After creating the Serverless deployment as described in the previous tutorial, the connection information will be visible in the Overview.

![Connection information](https://assets.emqx.com/images/c18e6c6825283c6e2a88187992a59b0d.png)

**Adding Authentication and ACL Rules:** Access Control should mirror what already exists in CloudMQTT.

**Use the MQTTX tool once more to connect to the Serverless deployment**

![MQTTX](https://assets.emqx.com/images/3175f71a9cd625fdca7c25c1b89dd2f1.png)

**Connection Support Notice**: EMQX Serverless supports connections on port 8883 (mqtts) and 8084 (wss). If you choose the Dedicated plan, you can use a custom domain name and port to connect. The Dedicated plan supports ports 1883 (mqtt), 8083 (ws), 8883 (mqtts), and 8084 (wss) by default. You can resolve the custom domain name to the connection address provided by the Dedicated plan, and you can raise a ticket to change the connection port for your deployment. The MQTTX client can connect to the Serverless deployment and subscribe and publish to the test topic.

![Connect to the Serverless deployment](https://assets.emqx.com/images/4c1da34290ac18246da99052cf916b9c.png)

**ACL Rule Restriction**: Since this rule denied subscription to the wildcard topic '#', the MQTTX client failed to subscribe to topic 'test1'.

![ACL Rule Restriction](https://assets.emqx.com/images/92142d4edfda9d22f6b7edcba93b7def.png)

From this, we have completed a simple demonstration of migrating from CloudMQTT to an EMQX Serverless deployment, primarily involving the change of connection address and port, as well as the synchronization of authentication and ACL rules.
