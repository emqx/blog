## Introduction

In recent years, with the increasing demand from players for interactive gaming, immersive experiences, and multiplayer online socialization, seamless real-time communication has become increasingly crucial for the gaming industry. However, traditional solutions struggle to meet the requirements of real-time gaming experiences in terms of low latency, high throughput communication, and message state synchronization. This leads to issues like unstable connections and packet loss, severely impacting player experience.

The [EMQX MQTT Platform](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) offers globally distributed MQTT message servers, helping gaming companies deliver uninterrupted connections and immediate responses for a smooth gaming experience. Through stable, cross-domain game services, gaming companies are able to earn recognition from players worldwide.

## Challenges of Real-Time Gaming Industry

- **Cross-Regional Communication and Compliance**: As more gaming companies expand into global markets, players may be scattered worldwide. This results in increased network latency between game servers and players, affecting the smoothness of real-time interactions and response times. Additionally, data communication needs to comply with local regulations in different countries and regions.
- **Privacy and Data Protection**: Global gamers face various cybersecurity threats and risks of privacy breaches. Gaming companies must implement multiple security measures in their messaging systems, such as encryption and access control, to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access.
- **Low Latency, High Concurrency**: Interactions between players and game servers require rapid responses. This necessitates systems with high concurrency data processing capabilities to ensure real-time and reliable message transmission.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: With the increasing number of players, gaming companies' messaging systems need horizontal scalability to smoothly transition when adding nodes, ensuring continuous operation.
- **Integration and Usability**: Gaming systems often need to interact with multiple external systems like databases and payment platforms. Messaging systems should offer rich API interfaces for seamless connection of message queues with external systems, enabling fast data transmission and synchronization at lower development costs.
