- Enhanced Rule Test: The rule test function allows users to view the results of the rule output after SQL processing in real-time. It also enables quick testing of SQL syntax, built-in functions, data templates, and other related features. In the latest version, we have improved the rule test function and made changes to the interface style to enhance its usability.

- Kafka Sink: A new Kafka Sink is added to support direct integration with Kafka to achieve efficient data stream processing.

## User Interface Optimization

We have redesigned and optimized the user interface of NeuronEX 3.2.0 to further enhance the user experience. By adjusting the interface layout, optimizing color matching, and improving interactive elements, we have made the interface more intuitive and easier to operate. 

In addition, we have made adjustments to the layout and components of the page to ensure that information is presented more clearly. This series of interface improvements will bring users a smoother and more intuitive operating experience, allowing them to complete various tasks more easily and efficiently, and better control the collection, processing, analysis and management of industrial data.

## Other Improvements

- **Single Sign-on (SSO) Support**: Single sign-on (SSO) support has been added to simplify user authentication and access management. [System Configuration | NeuronEX Docs](https://docs.emqx.com/en/neuronex/latest/admin/sys-configuration.html)
