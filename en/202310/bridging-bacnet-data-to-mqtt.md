In our previous blog post, we provided a beginner's guide to the [BACnet protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/bacnet-protocol-basic-concepts-structure-obejct-model-explained). In this article, we will explain the reasons for bridging BACnet with MQTT and provide instructions on how to do it.

## Why Bridge BACnet to MQTT？

As smart buildings become more popular, the equipment inside them has become networked. The trend toward cloud technology has led to the integration of single-building monitoring and remote unified monitoring, with a preference for cloud-side collaboration architecture. The primary challenge now is figuring out how to send BACnet network data to the cloud, both from a business and technical standpoint.

In the field of IoT, [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) is the de facto data transmission standard. It is a lightweight messaging protocol commonly used for remote monitoring and communication in IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to transfer messages between devices while effectively handling a large number of concurrent connections.

MQTT has several advantages that make it popular in IoT applications:

- **Lightweight**: MQTT is designed to be lightweight, requiring minimal processing power and memory, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.
- **Low-bandwidth**: MQTT is optimized for low-bandwidth networks, allowing efficient message transfer even over limited bandwidth connections.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: MQTT uses a publish-subscribe model, enabling asynchronous communication between clients. This allows for decoupled message exchange and better scalability.
- **QoS Levels**: MQTT supports various quality of service (QoS) levels for message delivery, allowing for different levels of reliability and message guarantees.
- **Easy Integration**: MQTT protocols are easy to integrate with various IoT platforms and applications, as it follows a simple and well-defined message format.
- **Robust Community**: MQTT has a robust and active community, providing extensive support and documentation, as well as open source tools and libraries for implementation and management.
- **Efficient Handling of Large Scale Connections**: MQTT is capable of handling a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, making it suitable for large-scale IoT deployments.

We can bridge BCAnet to MQTT to complement each other and solve the issues we have mentioned before.

## The Architecture of BACnet to MQTT Bridging

This blog uses [Neuron](https://neugates.io/) and [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) from EMQ to achieve BACnet to MQTT bridging. Neuron can convert the BACnet protocol to MQTT, while EMQX acts as an [MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison), handling massive connections and data.

Neuron is a modern [industrial IoT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/iiot-explained-examples-technologies-benefits-and-challenges) connectivity server that can connect various industrial devices that use standard protocols or device-specific protocols, achieving interconnection between industrial IoT platforms and various devices. As a lightweight industrial software, Neuron can run on various IoT edge hardware devices with limited resources. It aims to solve the problem of unified access to data-centric automation devices and provide basic support for intelligent manufacturing.

EMQX is a large-scale and elastic cloud-native distributed IoT MQTT message server. As the most scalable MQTT message server worldwide, EMQX provides efficient and reliable mass connection of IoT devices, capable of high-performance real-time processing of message and event flow data, helping users quickly build critical IoT platforms and applications.

The following diagram shows how Neuron collects data from the edge and converts it into MQTT for uploading to EMQX.

## Bridging BACnet to MQTT via Neuron

This section will introduce how to use Neuron to collect data from BACnet/IP devices, upload the collected data to EMQX, and view it using [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/).

### EMQX Quick Start

EMQX provides multiple installation methods; users can check the detailed installation methods in the [documentation](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v5.0/deploy/install.html). This example uses container deployment to quickly experience EMQX.

Run the following command to obtain the Docker image:

```
docker pull emqx/emqx-enterprise:5.1.0
```

Run the following command to start the Docker container:

```
docker run -d --name emqx-enterprise -p 1883:1883 -p 8083:8083 -p 8084:8084 -p 8883:8883 -p 18083:18083 emqx/emqx-enterprise:5.1.0
```

Access the EMQX Dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:18083` (replace “localhost” with your actual IP address) through a web browser. This allows you to manage device connections and monitor related metrics. Keep the Docker container running for this tutorial. You can refer to the [documentation](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v5.0/) to experience more features in the Dashboard.

#### Step 9: Subscribe to the Southbound Point Group

Click on any blank space of the newly created MQTT application node card to enter the subscription group interface, and click "Add Subscription".

Subscribe to the data group of southbound devices:

- South device: Select the created southbound device from the dropdown list, for example, bacnet-1;
- Group: Select the group to be subscribed to from the dropdown list, for example, group-1；
- Topic: The MQTT topic, which is default set as `/neuron/mqtt/bacnet-1/group-1` in this example. Next, subscribe to this topic and receive messages in MQTTX.

#### Step 10: View data in the MQTT Client.

After subscribing, you can use an [MQTT client](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-client-tools) to connect to EMQX and view the reported data. Here we use MQTTX, a powerful cross-platform MQTT client tool, which can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/mqttx).

Once MQTTX is launched, click **+ New Connection** on the main page, fill in the configuration parameters, and click **Connect** in the upper right corner.

- Name: Naming messages facilitate viewing. For example, naming them bacnet;
- Client ID: Using the default value is ok; ensure that the ID is independent;
- Host: Select **mqtt://** and fill in `localhost`(replace "localhost" with your actual IP address);
- Port: 1883.

Optional parameters can be filled in, and then click the **Connect** button on the upper right corner after completion. After a successful connection, subscribe to the topic.

Click **Add Subscription**, and the topic should be the same as the one in step 9. For example, fill in `/neuron/mqtt/bacnet-1/group-1`;

After a successful subscription, you can see that MQTTX continues to receive data collected and reported by Neuron. As shown in the following figure.
