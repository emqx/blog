## What Is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry (also known as OTel) is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs used for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) manages this open-source observability platform, which aims to provide all the necessary components to observe your services in a vendor-neutral manner.

OpenTelemetry enables developers to build standardized and interoperable telemetry data collection pipelines across a wide array of industries. It makes it easy for developers to instrument their software with telemetry data, whether they're working on a small, in-house project or a large-scale distributed system.

Observability is becoming a major focus of software development in many fields, but especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. IoT deployments are hyper-distributed, with as many as millions of connected devices. Because IoT devices have limited computing capabilities, it may not be possible to monitor them using traditional tools. This is where OpenTelemetry comes in, providing flexible ways to collect telemetry from IoT devices and achieve observability even for the most complex IoT environments.

We’ll introduce the basics of OpenTelemetry and then explain how it can help monitor and manage IoT communications, in particular using the [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt).

## 3 Core Concepts of OpenTelemetry

### Metrics

Metrics in OpenTelemetry are numerical representations of data measured over intervals of time. These could be measurements of system properties like CPU usage, memory consumption, or custom business metrics like the number of items in a shopping cart. Metrics help developers monitor the health of their applications and make informed decisions about resource allocation, performance tuning, and many other aspects of application development and maintenance.

### Logs

In OpenTelemetry, logs are timestamped records of discrete events. These events could be anything from an error or exception in your code, a system event, or a user operation. Logs are crucial for understanding the behavior of an application and for debugging purposes. They provide a granular view of the events that occur within an application, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

### Tracing

One of the core concepts of OpenTelemetry is tracing. A trace in OpenTelemetry is defined as the representation of a series of causally-related events in a system. These events can be anything from the start and end of a request, a database query, or a call to an external service. Tracing helps developers understand the sequence of events that led to a particular outcome, making it easier to debug and optimize their applications.

### OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector acts as a vendor-agnostic bridge between your applications and the backends that process the data. The Collector can ingest, process, and export telemetry data. It acts as an intermediary, allowing you to reduce the number of points of contact your applications need to make with your telemetry backend. It also standardizes your data so that it can be read by different telemetry backends.

### Language SDKs

OpenTelemetry provides Language SDKs in several languages like Java, Python, and Go, among others. The SDKs are necessary for developers to instrument their code to capture telemetry data. They provide APIs for manual instrumentation and also include automatic instrumentation libraries. The SDKs also handle batching and retry logic, making it easier for developers to ensure reliable data delivery.

### Agents and Instrumentation

Agents are the components that you install into your services to generate telemetry data. They automatically instrument your code, adding trace and metric data collection with minimal code changes. Instrumentation is the code that is inserted into your applications to collect the data. It can be manual, where developers add it to their code, or automatic, provided by the agents.

### Exporters

Exporters are the components that transmit the telemetry data from your services to the backends. They transform the data into the format that your backend can understand. OpenTelemetry provides several exporters for common backends like Jaeger and Prometheus, but you can also write your own custom exporters.

## Benefits of OpenTelemetry for IoT Deployments

### Benefits of OpenTelemetry for IoT Deployments

OpenTelemetry is increasingly being used to support observability in IoT environments. Here are several ways this versatile platform can benefit organizations managing large-scale IoT deployments:

- **Enhanced observability:** By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) systems with OpenTelemetry, you can gather data from various sources, including connected devices, to gain a holistic view of the system's functionality. This comprehensive view is invaluable in identifying bottlenecks, potential failures, and areas for optimization.
- **Improved troubleshooting:** OpenTelemetry also aids in troubleshooting by providing detailed insights into the system's operations. When issues arise, it can be difficult to identify the root cause, especially in distributed systems. However, OpenTelemetry's trace and log data can help pinpoint the point of failure and maintain system uptime.
- **Performance monitoring:** Performance monitoring is another significant benefit of using OpenTelemetry. It allows developers to track the performance of their applications in real-time, ensuring they meet the desired performance standards. If performance drops, developers can use the detailed metrics provided by OpenTelemetry to identify the cause and implement necessary optimizations.
- **Security insights:** OpenTelemetry provides valuable security insights, when it is used to track security-related events such as login attempts. Gaining visibility over security metrics and analyzing them can help identify security breaches or vulnerability, responding to them and securing IoT systems.
