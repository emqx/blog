## What Is a Smart Ship?

We’ve heard of smart cars, smart watches, and smart refrigerators, but what about smart ships? A smart ship, also known as an intelligent ship or a connected ship, is a vessel that incorporates various digital, automation, and communication technologies to integrate its operations, safety, efficiency, and environmental performance. Smart ships leverage modern technologies to improve navigation, maintenance, cargo management, crew welfare, and overall ship management.

## **Key Features of Smart Ships Include:**

### **Advanced Sensors and Systems** 

Smart ships are equipped with sensors that monitor engine performance, fuel consumption, weather conditions, cargo status, and equipment health. These sensors provide real-time data for analysis and decision-making.

### **Connectivity and Communication**

Smart ships use robust communication systems, including satellite communication, high-speed internet, and wireless networks, to enable seamless data exchange between the ship, onshore control centers, and other vessels. This connectivity supports remote monitoring, management, and communication.

### **Automation and Autonomous Capabilities**

Smart ships often incorporate automation technologies, such as automated navigation, collision avoidance systems, and machinery control systems. Some smart ships are designed with varying degrees of autonomous capabilities, enabling them to operate with minimal human intervention.

### **Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence**

Data collected from sensors and systems are analyzed using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These technologies help predict equipment failures, optimize fuel consumption, recommend navigation routes, and provide insights for operational improvements.

### **Energy Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability**

Smart ships prioritize energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact. They may integrate renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines, optimize fuel consumption, and minimize emissions through advanced control systems.

### **Remote Monitoring and Control**

In real-time, ship operators and owners can remotely monitor and control ship systems, equipment, and operations. This capability allows for efficient maintenance, troubleshooting, and decision-making.

### **Cargo Management and Safety**

Smart ships use technology to monitor and manage cargo loading, unloading, and storage. This enhances cargo security, minimizes handling risks, and ensures compliance with safety regulations.

### **Crew Welfare and Safety**

Advanced communication tools, entertainment systems, and monitoring solutions improve crew welfare and safety onboard. Crew members can stay connected with their families and receive timely emergency assistance. With increased digitalization, smart ships emphasize cybersecurity to protect critical ship systems and data from potential cyber threats.

### **Integration with Port Operations**

Smart ships can interact with port facilities to optimize scheduling, cargo handling, and navigation, improving overall port efficiency.

## What Are the Next Steps?

The concept of a smart ship is part of the broader digital transformation in the maritime industry, aiming to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, comply with regulations, and promote sustainable practices for new and existing ships.  However, there are several obstacles:

- Legacy ship components and sensors cannot communicate in a standard format.
- Ship diagnostic data is siloed and difficult to access or centralize.
- External factors, weather, weight, and other vessels affect route planning.

The initial investment to convert ships to smart ships is capital-intensive, and the ecosystem must evolve before standards are built. The required talent can be relatively hard to find in this sector.

Technology companies like **Alpha Ori** use MQTT services through [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) to provide a faster solution.

## **Here's How MQTT Builds Smart ships:**

### **Efficient Communication**

MQTT's lightweight publish-subscribe architecture makes it efficient for transmitting data between different ship systems and devices, even in bandwidth-constrained environments.

### **Real-Time Monitoring and Control**

MQTT’s efficient handling of telemetry data enables real-time monitoring of ship systems, allowing operators to receive immediate updates on critical parameters and take timely actions to optimize operations or address issues.

### **Remote Management**

[MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) was designed for distributed communication and supports remote management and control, enabling onshore personnel to monitor and control ship systems, diagnose problems, and perform maintenance tasks from a distance.

### **Broad Integration**

MQTT is a widely adopted ISO standard protocol for IoT, making it easy to collect ship data from various sensors, integrate ship data with onshore logistics, maintenance, and supply chain systems, generate alerts and notifications, and feed data analysis systems.

### **Resilience and Redundancy**

MQTT's ability to handle intermittent or unstable network connections is invaluable for maintaining communication and data exchange in challenging maritime conditions.

## MQTT on the High Seas

MQTT is a valuable communication protocol for smart ships. The specific technologies and protocols used may vary depending on the ship's architecture, the types of systems and sensors onboard, and the requirements of the ship's operations. However, many of these systems can be converted to communicate over the MQTT protocol, enabling widespread fleet integration.
