Recently, [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud), a fully managed MQTT messaging cloud service, has released a feature update: the “Log” module has been optimized and several new analysis parameters have been added to help users conduct more effective system monitoring and operation and maintenance.

## Feature overview

As a fully managed MQTT cloud service designed to relieve users of the burden of infrastructure management and maintenance, EMQX Cloud helps users keep abreast of system operation through real-time online viewing of logs, tracing and troubleshooting problems found to ensure stable system operation.

The previous log analysis parameters included only time, log level and instance ID, which are relatively basic. The latest version has optimized the feature and added optional parameters, including client ID, client IP, username, topic, resource ID, and rule ID, for users to filter and search, so as to locate errors and solve problems more accurately and quickly. And the node will be displayed directly in the log details.

## Use guide

Users can query logs by clicking “Logs” after entering the console. The default parameters are display time, log level, error type, client ID and client IP, and click on “more” to expand targeted log search based on username, topic, resource ID and rule ID.
