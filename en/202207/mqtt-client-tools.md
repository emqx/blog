With the rapid development of the IoT industry, the MQTT protocol is being used by more and more companies and developers. In the process of [learning and using MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt), a handy client tool can greatly facilitate developers to explore MQTT features and debug IoT applications, shortening the development cycle.

There is a wide variety of MQTT client tools with different functional focuses. For beginners and even MQTT experts, it is a challenge to choose a suitable MQTT client tool.

We have selected seven of the most useful MQTT client tools in 2022 and listed them by desktop, browser, and command line categories. We hope this article will help you quickly find a suitable client tool for MQTT testing.

## How to choose an MQTT client?

MQTT client tools are commonly used to establish connections to [MQTT brokers](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison) for subscription, message sending and receiving operations. A good MQTT client tool should have the following features.

- Support for one-way and two-way SSL authentication.
- Support for [MQTT 5](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/mqtt5) features.
- Maintain ease of use on a full-featured basis.
- Support for multiple clients online at the same time.
- Cross-platform, available under different operating systems.
- Support MQTT over WebSocket.
- Advanced features: Customized script, logging, payload format conversion, etc.

### MQTT.fx

MQTT.fx was developed by Jens Deters. Since January 2021 MQTT.fx has moved to Softblade - a new founded German company now taking care about further development of MQTT.fx, and released the commercial version MQTT.fx® 5.0. The MQTT.fx described in this article is the free 1.x version.

MQTT.fx is developed with JavaFX, supports saving multiple connection configurations, multiple types of encryption methods, specifies multiple types of certificates, and can set an HTTP proxy server when creating a connection.

In general, MQTT.fx has rich and mature functions and supports many configuration items in TCP connections, but users can only establish one connection at a time. In addition, it does not implement support for WebSocket and cannot be used in the test scenario of MQTT over WebSocket.

#### Features

- Predefine message template
- Get the status of the broker through the system topic `$SYS`
- Support for JavaScript scripts through Nashorn Engine
- Support log display, display log information in the connection
- Cross-platform desktop with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux
