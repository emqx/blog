The public announcement first appeared at the top of its IoT Core web page, followed by emails to its customers, notifying that exactly one year from now, access to IoT Core Device Manager APIs “**will no longer be available. As of that date, devices will be unable to connect to the Google Cloud IoT Core MQTT and HTTP bridges and existing connections will be shut down.**”

Now is the time to consider your best Google Cloud IoT Core alternative.

Given that Google IoT Core is based on MQTT, the best alternative options for seamless migration undoubtedly are MQTT-based IoT messaging platforms or services. As a trusted partner to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), EMQ has already brought solid and well-rounded IoT connectivity solutions to our mutual customers.
