## Google IoT Core Will Be Discontinued in 2023

Google announced the retirement of their Cloud IoT Core service **on August 16, 2023,** emailing customers to say bluntly that **“your access to the IoT Core Device Manager APIs will no longer be available. As of that date, devices will be unable to connect to the Google Cloud IoT Core MQTT and HTTP bridges and existing connections will be shut down.”**

There is obviously a pressing need for existing users to find a replacement for the IoT Core.

Given that Google IoT Core is based on MQTT, the best alternative options for seamless migration undoubtedly are MQTT-based IoT messaging platforms or services. 



## Choose EMQX as Your Perfect Replacement for Google IoT Core

As an official Google Cloud migration partner, EMQ Technologies Inc. has brought solid and well-round IoT connectivity solutions to our mutual customers. We are here to provide ideal migration options for those seeking the best Google IoT Core alternatives.

## A True Seamless and Effortless Migration from Google IoT Core

EMQX has developed into the on-premises version, EMQX Enterprise, and the SaaS version, EMQX Cloud, to meet the demands of different types and scales of enterprises and accelerate the digitalization, real-time and intelligent transformation for them.

### EMQX Cloud - Fully Managed MQTT Service

EMQX Cloud is the world's first fully managed MQTT 5.0 public cloud service launched by EMQ, providing MQTT message service with a one-stop operation and maintenance host and a unique isolated environment for MQTT services. EMQX Cloud can help you quickly build industry applications and easily realize the collection, transmission, computation, and persistence of IoT data.

With announcing [support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introducing-emqx-cloud-on-google-cloud-platform)) in September 2021, EMQX Cloud is the world's first and only fully-managed MQTT service that supports all major public cloud platforms, including GCP, AWS, and Azure. Enterprises using Google Cloud IoT Core to manage their IoT infrastructures, whether on GCP or other cloud platforms, can migrate their IoT applications and endpoints to EMQX Cloud seamlessly and effortlessly.

EMQX Cloud supports VPC peering on GCP. Users who want to migrate from Google IoT Core simply need to choose Google Cloud as the cloud platform when creating new deployments on EMQX Cloud. EMQX cluster and user's resources on GCP, such as Cloud SQL, Kafka, MongoDB, and InfluxDB, can communicate by establishing a VPC peering connection. This communication is under the same network, making it more secure and reliable as it's a private network connection.

### EMQX Enterprise - Self-managed MQTT messaging platform

[EMQX Enterprise](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) is a large-scale distributed MQTT messaging platform that can be deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in multiple ways. You can easily and quickly migrate your devices on IoT Core to EMQX Enterprise and then continue to integrate with your data services in GCP, without affecting the existing business.

EMQX Enterprise is suitable for deployment with strict requirements and needs to be deployed in a specified deployment environment, especially in a private environment. Meanwhile, the enterprise has a relatively complete team for operation, maintenance, and support with daily basic software operation and maintenance.
