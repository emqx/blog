Google announced the retirement of their Cloud IoT Core service **on August 16, 2023,** emailing customers to say bluntly that **“your access to the IoT Core Device Manager APIs will no longer be available. As of that date, devices will be unable to connect to the Google Cloud IoT Core MQTT and HTTP bridges and existing connections will be shut down.”**

There is obviously a pressing need for existing users to find a replacement for the IoT Core.

Given that Google IoT Core is based on MQTT, the best alternative options for seamless migration undoubtedly are MQTT-based IoT messaging platforms or services. 

As an official Google Cloud migration partner, EMQ has brought solid and well-round IoT connectivity solutions to our mutual customers. We are here to provide ideal migration options for those seeking the best Google IoT Core alternatives. EMQX, the world’s most scalable open source MQTT Broker, and [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud), a fully-managed MQTT service [available on Google Cloud Platform](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introducing-emqx-cloud-on-google-cloud-platform), are both based on **open standards,100% compliance with MQTT 5.0 and 3.x standards and deep integration with GCP.**
