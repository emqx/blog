We are excited to announce a landmark update to [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud), marking its evolution from a leading managed MQTT service to a comprehensive, unified MQTT data platform. This release introduces powerful new features and significant enhancements designed to provide greater flexibility, reduce costs, and streamline your entire IoT data journey.

This is a pivotal moment for EMQX Cloud. Our vision has always been to simplify IoT data management. With these updates, we are empowering you to connect, process, store, and analyze your data seamlessly within a single, powerful platform.

## **Introducing Dedicated Flex: More Flexibility, Fair Pricing**

We've upgraded our Dedicated Edition to **Dedicated Flex**, a new plan engineered to offer ultimate control and reflect a pricing philosophy that is **Fair, Simple, Transparent, and Predictable.**

- **Unbundled Sessions & TPS:** We recognize that a 1:1 ratio doesn't fit every use case. With Dedicated Flex, you can now choose the exact combination you need—for example, 1,000 sessions with just 100 TPS—reducing unnecessary costs and ensuring optimized resource usage.
- **Lower Starting Price:** The entry price is reduced from **$0.36/hour to $0.32/hour**, a 12% decrease. Customers running the same number of sessions but with lower TPS can now achieve even greater savings.
- **Fair, Usage-Based Scaling**: As TPS increases, the unit price scales proportionally, aligning costs with actual usage. Overall, EMQX Cloud remains **40%–80% more cost-effective than AWS IoT Core**, while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.
- **More Value, All-Inclusive:** To further simplify your billing, NAT Gateway and Internal Endpoint features are now included in the Dedicated Flex plan at no additional charge.
- **Future Integration:** Dedicated Flex will seamlessly integrate with the upcoming EMQX Tables service.
- **No Impact for Existing Users:** Current Dedicated deployments remain unaffected. You can continue using them or create new Dedicated Flex deployments.

## **EMQX Tables (Preview) Coming Soon - Purpose-Built for IoT Data**

A crucial part of our platform evolution is the upcoming launch of **EMQX Tables**, a new storage service designed from the ground up for the unique demands of IoT and time-series data.

This marks a turning point for EMQX Cloud: transforming it from a single [MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison) service into a unified platform for:

- Device connectivity
- Data collection and processing
- Storage and querying
- Real-time analytics

You can now [**join the waiting list**](https://www.emqx.com/en/lp/emqx-tables) to gain early access to EMQX Tables Preview.

## **A Reimagined User Experience: The All-New EMQX Cloud Console**

To support our expanded, multi-service platform, we have completely redesigned the EMQX Cloud Console.

- **A Modern, Intuitive Interface:** The new console features a cleaner layout and a more logical structure, making navigation and management more straightforward than ever.
- **Project-Centric Workflow:** The console is now organized around projects. Within a single project, you can create and manage multiple services, such as your EMQX Broker and the upcoming EMQX Tables.
- **Seamless Service Integration:** Services created within the same project are designed to work together seamlessly, simplifying data flow and integration.

## A New Chapter for EMQX Cloud

This release represents more than feature updates. It's the beginning of EMQX Cloud's transformation from a managed MQTT broker to a comprehensive MQTT data platform. By combining flexible connectivity options, integrated data storage, and unified management, we're enabling organizations to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.
