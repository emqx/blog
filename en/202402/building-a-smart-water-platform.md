## Overview

Smart water operation involves optimizing and intelligently managing water supply and drainage using advanced technology and data analysis methods.

The EMQX MQTT Platform enables water enterprises to build a smart water operation platform quickly by sharing and integrating data and leveraging cloud computing and big data technologies for data analysis and decision-making. In previous cases of smart water management platforms at the city-level, EMQX has successfully helped water enterprises improve platform construction efficiency by over 30%, reduce IoT data acquisition costs by more than 35%, and decrease operational costs by over 40%.

## Challenges of Building a Smart Water Operation Platform

### Non-Standard Construction of Plant Stations

There is a lack of real-time centralized supervision for water utility plant station data. The self-control systems at various plant stations do not comply with uniform construction standards, and the network deployment lacks planning. This hinders the aggregation of data and the application of big data analytics, making it difficult for data mining efforts.

### Severe System Barriers

Remote water meters lack standardized data transmission, leading to repeated meter reading platforms and data barriers, hindering unified management.

### Data Quality Constraints for Big Data Platforms

There is a lack of standardization in accessing data related to plant stations, meter readings, and other business data, which has resulted in inconsistent data quality. Various types of data scattered across different systems make it difficult to provide real-time and format-compliant data sources for the big data center.

### Comprehensive Perception of Water IoT Devices

The edge industrial protocol gateway, NeuronEX, supports various PLC drivers such as Modbus, OPC UA, IEC 104, Siemens S7, etc. It can be flexibly deployed in water supply pump stations, pipeline networks, water plants, and user terminals of water systems to achieve real-time monitoring and control of water sources, quality, quantity, pressure, pumps, etc., through sensors, smart water meters, and other intelligent devices.

NeuronEX can perform real-time data processing and analysis on edge devices close to the data source, implementing message standardization, abnormal event monitoring, logic feedback, device linkage, etc., at the edge. This reduces data transmission delays, rapidly responds to data changes, and enhances system robustness.

### Unified IoT Message Bus for Tens of Millions of Data

EMQX possesses the capabilities of a high-availability cluster, encrypted authentication, rule engine, data integration, and other enterprise-level message bus features. It provides a unified, secure, and efficiently integrated IoT platform for water management, helping manage the messages generated by hundreds of thousands or even millions of smart water devices every second in a city. This platform can integrate cloud computing, big data, and AI to achieve intelligent water operations, covering water resource management, supply, sewage treatment, quality monitoring, consumption, and more.

### Massive Streaming Data Processing

On the platform side, HStream Platform provides massive data distributed storage and streaming processing capabilities, interfaces with big data platforms and time-series databases, and enables real-time data shuffling and pre-processing. It offers robust support for precision management and rapid business decision-making in smart water management platforms.

### Cloud-Edge Collaborative Management

EMQX provides a unified cloud-edge module with a web-based control interface, enabling remote configuration, real-time monitoring, and log analysis of the edge software NeuronEX. This reduces the cost of on-site operations and maintenance.

## The Advantages of EMQX MQTT Platform

### Robust Foundation for IoT Construction 

EMQX provides comprehensive capabilities in water utility intelligent terminal data acquisition and control, edge computing, high-concurrency message bus, big data integration, AI algorithm integration, and data security authentication. This forms the basis for developing IoT data capabilities for intelligent operational analytics.

### Enhancing Operational Performance

EMQX's rule engine stores low-latency messages persistently in the database at a speed of over one hundred thousand per second, with the capability of providing a million messages per second concurrency. This provides high real-time, high-frequency, and high-precision data necessary for intelligent algorithms, improving the accuracy of data analysis and decision-making.

### Reducing Costs

NeuronEX can be deployed on edge gateways, industrial control computers, MEC, and servers, making full use of existing hardware resources based on network conditions to choose the optimal and cost-effective deployment method. It can assist producers in remotely managing various aspects of edge module access, inspections, configurations, upgrades, updates, and alarm handling, significantly enhancing the level of intelligent management.

### Continuous Adaptation to Future Development

EMQX utilizes a clustered deployment that allows for horizontal scaling by adding nodes, making it easy to expand the system. Its interfaces are flexible and easily expandable, enabling the future integration of new technologies and systems. At the edge, it can integrate with Go, Python extensions, and AI algorithms, promoting innovative development in edge intelligence.
