## MQTT Serverless Based on a Multi-Tenant Architecture

As cloud computing evolves, Serverless is emerging as a leading trend and the future of cloud technology. EMQX Cloud Serverless, as a Serverless MQTT Broker, provides a cutting-edge solution for fully automated construction, deployment, and scaling of MQTT services. Users can eliminate the need to manage deployment and maintenance, and instead focus all their efforts on IoT-powered business logic and product development.

### Lightning-Fast Deployment in Just 5 Seconds

EMQX Cloud Serverless leverages a clustered multi-tenancy architecture, as opposed to traditional single-tenant clusters. This innovative approach allows for efficient utilization of service capacity through sharing across multiple tenants while maintaining complete isolation of each tenant's data and communication for maximum security. Moreover, well-planned configuration and limiting ensure that the high concurrency of any one tenant does not negatively impact the performance of others.

With its multi-tenant architecture, EMQX Cloud Serverless enables swift and efficient sharing of the created cluster, reducing the time required for cluster deployment creation. In just 5 seconds, developers can establish a secure, reliable, and fully functional MQTT Broker.

### Auto Scaling

The Serverless approach emphasizes the "No Server" aspect for users, meaning that cloud vendors take care of the servers, so users can focus solely on their business without being concerned with the resources and scaling.

EMQX Cloud Serverless offers a streamlined and convenient solution for developers with its automated MQTT services. Its fully managed model reduces deployment and maintenance costs for users, and its intelligent, self-scaling capabilities make it possible to smoothly respond to fluctuating business demands, leading to a significant decrease in the total cost.

## Cost-Effective, Pay-As-You-Go

EMQX Cloud Serverless provides an economical option for IoT app development with its pay-as-you-go model. It calculates usage based on **the number of connected devices and online time**. With a complimentary monthly credit of 1M minutes, equivalent to about 23 devices online for a month, projects with limited device usage can enjoy the service at a minimal cost. This adaptable pricing model also helps users save costs in situations where device numbers and traffic vary due to business changes.

In addition, EMQX Cloud Serverless offers enhanced user-friendliness with its ability to dynamically support **up to 1000 devices concurrently**, making it an ideal solution for users with a low volume of devices. 

For a typical scenario with 20-30 devices and normal message frequency and size, the cost is negligible, saving users from the expenses of infrastructure software. As the business grows and the number of devices increases, the service can effortlessly scale, eliminating the need for infrastructure migration and reducing overall costs.
