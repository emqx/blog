## Modbus Introduction

Modbus is a serial communication protocol used to connect industrial automation devices. Originally developed by Modicon in 1979, it has evolved into one of the universal communication standards widely used in industrial automation scenarios.

Modbus adopts a master-slave mode and supports multiple transmission modes, including serial (RS-232/485) and Ethernet versions (TCP/IP). It is mainly used for monitoring and controlling automation equipment such as sensors, motors, and PLCs. It facilitates data exchange between devices and enables the transmission of control commands, allowing different devices to coordinate with each other.

The Modbus protocol defines four types of storage areas: Coils, Discrete Inputs, Input Registers, and Holding Registers. Different types of storage areas correspond to different read-write operations.

| **Storage Area Name** | **Data Type** | **Access Type** | **PLC Address** | **Register Address** |
| :-------------------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- |
| Coils                 | Bit           | Read/Write      | 000001-065536   | 0-65535              |
| Discrete Inputs       | Bit           | Read Only       | 100001-165536   | 0-65535              |
| Input Registers       | Word          | Read Only       | 300001-365536   | 0-65535              |
| Holding Registers     | Word          | Read/Write      | 400001-465536   | 0-65535              |

Each storage area has its own address range and read/write operation code. It is important to choose the appropriate storage area for reading and writing operations according to the application scenario.

Taking Modbus TCP as an example, its message structure includes MBAP(Modbus Application Protocol Header)+PDU(Protocol Data Unit).

![MBAP+PDU](https://assets.emqx.com/images/c6c3b139b43fb435e0fdf258f8972073.png)

The Modbus protocol defines multiple function codes for accessing and manipulating memory areas. Below are some commonly used function codes.

| **Function Code** | **Function**             | **Operation Type** | **Number of Operations** |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------- |
| 01                | Read Coil                | Bit Operation      | Single or Multiple       |
| 02                | Read Discrete Inputs     | Bit Operation      | Single or Multiple       |
| 03                | Read Holding Registers   | Word Operation     | Single or Multiple       |
| 04                | Read Input Registers     | Word Operation     | Single or Multiple       |
| 05                | Write Single Coil        | Bit Operation      | Single                   |
| 06                | Write Single Register    | Word Operation     | Single                   |
| 15                | Write Multiple Coils     | Bit Operation      | Multiple                 |
| 16                | Write Multiple Registers | Word Operation     | Multiple                 |

Assuming the slave ID is 01H and the starting address of the holding register to be read is 006BH, and 2 registers are to be read, the instruction is as follows:

| **Slave ID** | **Function Code** | **Starting Address(High Byte)** | **Starting Address(Low Byte)** | **Number of Registers(High Byte)** | **Number of Registers(Low Byte)** |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| 01           | 03                | 00                              | 6B                             | 00                                 | 02                                |

Each holding register has a length of 2 bytes. The low-addressed registers are transmitted first, followed by the high-addressed registers. For each register, the high byte is transmitted first, followed by the low byte. The response is as follows:

| **Slave ID** | **Function Code** | **Number of Bytes** | **006BH(High Byte)** | **006BH(Low Byte)** | **006CH(High Byte)** | **006CH(Low Byte)** |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :------------------ |
| 01           | 03                | 04                  | 00                   | 00                  | 00                   | 00                  |

## Why Bridge Modbus to MQTT?

With the advent of Industry 4.0, there is an increasing demand for intelligence, automation and digitization in manufacturing. In this context, the Modbus protocol faces some challenges:

- Firstly, the Modbus protocol has significant security issues. Its straightforward communication method renders it susceptible to security risks, including hacking attacks and data tampering.
- Secondly, when it comes to real-time performance and bandwidth utilization, the Modbus protocol falls short in comparison to modern industrial communication standards. Especially in the case of large-scale device networking, traditional serial communication methods are no longer sufficient to meet requirements.
- In addition, in terms of multi-level architecture and cloud platform applications, the Modbus protocol also has certain limitations. It can only perform point-to-point communication and does not support distributed systems and cloud computing platforms very well.

Compared with Modbus protocol, the [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) has obvious advantages. The MQTT  protocol is a lightweight message transmission protocol based on [publish/subscribe model](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-5-introduction-to-publish-subscribe-model) that is built on TCP/IP protocol. It was released by IBM in 1999 and became an officially approved communication standard by OASIS in 2014. Currently it has been widely applied in areas such as Internet of Things (IoT), mobile internet, smart hardware, connected cars, smart cities, remote healthcare services, power industry, oil and energy.

Here are some of the advantages of MQTT.

- **Lightweight**: MQTT is very lightweight and can be used in environments with limited bandwidth and poor network quality.
- **Flexibility**: MQTT supports multiple connection methods and enables flexible message transmission through the subscribe/publish model.
- **Reliability**: MQTT ensures reliable message transmission, even in case of network interruption, by allowing reconnection and communication restoration.
- **Security**: MQTT supports SSL/TLS encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure data security.

Therefore, in the field of IoT, MQTT is more suitable for message transmission in distributed systems.

## The Architecture of Modbus to MQTT Bridging

The Modbus to MQTT bridging architecture consists of two main components: the Modbus data source and the [MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison). The data source sends Modbus data to the MQTT broker, which then receives and forwards it. To achieve this process, two essential elements are required: an edge device responsible for converting the Modbus protocol into MQTT and transmitting the data to the MQTT broker, and an MQTT broker that handles MQTT messages.

In this article, we use [Neuron](https://neugates.io/) and [EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/) to implement the bridging process.

[Neuron](https://neugates.io/) is a modern industrial IoT connectivity server that can connect various industrial devices using standard or proprietary protocols, achieving interconnectivity between industrial IoT platforms and devices. As a lightweight industrial software, Neuron can run on various IoT edge hardware devices with limited resources. It aims to solve the problem of difficult unified access to automation equipment data centered around data and provide basic support for intelligent manufacturing.

[EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/) is the world’s leading open-source distributed IoT MQTT broker with high performance and scalability. EMQX provides efficient and reliable connections for massive IoT devices, enabling high-performance real-time movement and processing of the message and event flow data, helping users quickly build IoT platforms and applications for critical business.

The following diagram shows how Neuron collects data from the edge and converts it into MQTT for uploading to EMQX.

## IIoT Use Cases

### Implementing Oil Production Data Acquisition

As the scale of digital construction in oil production expands, the number of automated equipment is increasing, resulting in the complexity of data acquisition and management. 

By building an open equipment data network, an oil production plant data center can connect directly with different data acquisition devices, such as RTUs, DTUs and PLCs. With industrial protocol gateway software like Neuron, Modbus/TCP and vendor-specific protocols can be converted into MQTT data, a standard IoT protocol that can be collected, processed, and reported in real-time. This facilitates the storage and data consumption of the upper business system.

![Oil Production Data Acquisition](https://assets.emqx.com/images/5c5a23f0474e9305c1f4d0026176f01b.png)

An overall solution combining Neuron and other EMQ products like [EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/), [eKuiper](https://ekuiper.org/) and [EMQX ECP](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx-ecp) can bring the following benefits to oil industry:

- A system architecture that is light on the frontend and heavy on the backend, reducing field equipment and system operation and maintenance costs.
- Improved business system responsiveness through real-time reporting of production data by using the MQTT IoT protocol as the main method of data collection and transmission.
- Aggregation of massive amounts of real-time data from heterogeneous equipment and systems, including storage of various types of production and monitoring equipment.
- The decoupling of data collection and data consumption systems through a unified access middleware platform and rich data interfaces, making application development easier and more efficient.

### Empowering Industrial Networking, Digitization, and Intelligence

An unified one-stop Industrial IoT data platform becomes essential in the context of Industry 4.0.

Neuron supports Modbus, OPC-UA, IEC61850, IEC104, and other complete industrial protocols to realize efficient access to data of heterogeneous industrial equipment. The data collected in real-time is captured, filtered, complemented, and time-windowed calculated at the edge by eKuiper, a lightweight edge streaming processing engine, to provide a high-quality data source for edge AI inference services. 

By enabling real-time data connectivity, movement, storage, processing, and analysis at the cloud side, this facilitates a robust data foundation for big data analysis and artificial intelligence applications, empowering enterprises to rapidly develop upper-layer applications.
