Serverless architecture in cloud computing allows developers to focus on code development and deployment without the hassle of infrastructure management. Serverless MQTT, in particular, provides an MQTT messaging service that scales automatically based on demand, reducing the need for manual intervention.

To learn more about serverless MQTT, read our blog post [Next-Gen Cloud MQTT Service: Meet EMQX Cloud Serverless](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/next-gen-cloud-mqtt-service-meet-emqx-cloud-serverless). In this blog series, we'll guide you through using various client libraries to set up MQTT connections, subscriptions, messaging, and more with a serverless MQTT broker for your specific project.

## Introduction

Java is widely used in IoT devices, including low-power sensors and microcontrollers. It provides a rich set of libraries and frameworks for building IoT applications, as well as robust support for networking and concurrency.

One useful library is the Paho Java Client, an [MQTT client library](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt-client-sdk) that enables the development of applications for the JVM or other Java-compatible platforms such as Android. This blog will use the Paho Java Client to connect a serverless MQTT broker. The whole project can be downloaded at [MQTT Client Examples](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-Java).

## Free Serverless MQTT Broker

[EMQX Cloud Serverless](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud/serverless-mqtt) is the latest [MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.io/) offering on the public cloud with all the serverless advantages. You can start the Serverless deployment in seconds with just a few clicks. Additionally, users can get 1 million free session minutes every month, sufficient for 23 devices to be online for a whole month, making it perfect for tiny IoT test scenarios.

If you have not tried serverless deployment yet, please follow [the guide in this blog](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-serverless-mqtt-service) to create one for free. Once you have completed the registration process with the online guide, you will get a running instance with the following similar information from the “Overview” in your deployment. We will use the connection information and CA certificate later.

## Connection Code Demo

### 1. Install JDK, Apache Maven and Intellij IDEA

If you don’t have a Java environment on your computer yet, please [download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and install JDK.

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. In this project, we use Maven as the build tool. You can follow the [instruction](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to install it.

We use Intellij IDEA as the IDE. You can download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) and install it with just a few simple clicks.

### 2. Add MQTT dependency

To use the Paho Java Client library in your Java application, add the following dependency to the pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.paho</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.5</version>
</dependency>
```

### 3. Create a MqttConnectionOptions object

The `MqttConnectionOptions` object is used to set the various options for the MQTT connection. You can set options such as the username and password.

```
    private static final String USERNAME = "emqxtest";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "*******";
    private static final int CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 300;
    private static final boolean CLEAN_SESSION = true;
    
    MqttConnectOptions options = new MqttConnectOptions();
      options.setUserName(USERNAME);
      options.setPassword(PASSWORD.toCharArray());
      options.setConnectionTimeout(CONNECT_TIMEOUT);
      options.setCleanSession(CLEAN_SESSION);
```

- Username and password: To establish a client connection, please make sure that you provide the correct username and password. The following image shows how to configure these credentials under 'Authentication & ACL - Authentication' on the server side.

![Authentication & ACL](https://assets.emqx.com/images/356ec09d07fe9e52960b1c758d0e530e.png)

### 4. Using TLS/SSL

When connecting to EMQX Serverless, it is important to note that it relies on a multi-tenant architecture, which enables multiple users to share a single EMQX cluster. In order to ensure the security and reliability of data transmission within this multi-tenant environment, TLS is required. 

To set up an SSL/TLS connection, create an instance of `SSLSocketFactory` and set it as the socket factory for the [MQTT client](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-client-tools). If the server is utilizing a self-signed certificate, download the corresponding CA file from the deployment overview panel and provide it during the connection setup process.

```
//configure the CA file
private static final String CA_CERT_PATH = EmqxTlsExample.class.getResource("/broker.emqx.io-ca.crt").getPath();
options.setSocketFactory(getSocketFactory(CA_CERT_PATH));
```

```
//
public static SSLSocketFactory getSocketFactory(String caCertPath) throws Exception {
        CertificateFactory certFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");

        // load CA certificate into keystore to authenticate server
        Certificate caCert = certFactory.generateCertificate(new FileInputStream(caCertPath));
        X509Certificate x509CaCert = (X509Certificate) caCert;

        KeyStore caKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
        caKeyStore.load(null, null);
        caKeyStore.setCertificateEntry("cacert", x509CaCert);

        TrustManagerFactory tmFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
        tmFactory.init(caKeyStore);

        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLSv1.2");
        sslContext.init(null, tmFactory.getTrustManagers(), null);

        return sslContext.getSocketFactory();
    }
```

For project configuration, you need to add [bcpkix-jdk15on](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcpkix-jdk15on) to the pom.xml file.

```
    <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcpkix-jdk15on -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
        <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
        <version>1.70</version>
    </dependency>
```

### 5. Create an MqttClient Object

The MqttClient object is used for connecting to the EMQ X Cloud Serverless broker. To create an MqttClient object, you need to pass in the broker address, port, and client ID.

```
private static final String BROKER = "******.emqxsl.com";
private static final String PORT = "8883";
private static final String CLIENT_ID = MqttClient.generateClientId();
private static final String TOPIC = "java-mqtt/tls";
    
String server = "ssl://" + BROKER + ":" + PORT;
client = new MqttClient(server, CLIENT_ID);
```

- Broker and port: Obtain the connection address and port information from the server deployment overview page.
- Client ID: Every MQTT client must have a unique client ID. You can use `Guid.NewGuid()` to generate a new unique identifier in .NET.
- Topic: Topics are used to identify and differentiate between different messages, forming the basis of MQTT message routing. It will be used when subscribing and publishing.

### 6. Connect to the broker

Now that you have created the MQTT client and set up the connection options, you are ready to connect to the broker. Simply use the `connect` method of the MQTT client to establish a connection and start sending and receiving messages.

```
client.subscribe(TOPIC, QoS);
System.out.println("Subscribed to topic: " + TOPIC);
```

### 7. Subscribe to topics

Set the topic for subscription and the [QoS Level ](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introduction-to-mqtt-qos)of the topic.

```
MqttMessage msg = new MqttMessage(PAYLOAD.getBytes());
msg.setQos(QoS);
client.publish(TOPIC, msg);
System.out.println("Message published");
```

### 8. Publish messages

Inform MQTT Broker about the topic and payload when publishing messages.

```
client.setCallback(new MqttCallback() {

    public void connectionLost(Throwable cause) {
        System.out.println(MessageFormat.format("Connection lost. Cause: {0}", cause));
    }

    public void messageArrived(String topic, MqttMessage message) throws Exception {
        System.out.println(MessageFormat.format("Callback: received message from topic {0}: {1}",
                topic, message.toString()));
    }

    public void deliveryComplete(IMqttDeliveryToken token) {
        try {
            System.out.println(MessageFormat.format("Callback: delivered message to topics {0}",
                    Arrays.asList(token.getTopics())));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### 9. Receive Messages

This code sets up an event listener for incoming messages in the MQTT client. When a message is received, it triggers a callback function that prints the message content and topic to the console.

```
client.setcallback(new mqttcallback() {

    public void connectionlost(throwable cause) {
        system.out.println(messageformat.format("connection lost. cause: {0}", cause));
    }

    public void messagearrived(string topic, mqttmessage message) throws exception {
        system.out.println(messageformat.format("callback: received message from topic {0}: {1}",
                topic, message.tostring()));
    }

    public void deliverycomplete(imqttdeliverytoken token) {
        try {
            system.out.println(messageformat.format("callback: delivered message to topics {0}",
                    arrays.aslist(token.gettopics())));
        } catch (exception e) {
            e.printstacktrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### 10. Unsubscribe to Topics

Use the following codes to unsubscribe to topics.

```
client.unsubscribe(topic);
```

### 11. Disconnect

To disconnect, call:

```
System.out.println("Disconnect from broker: " + server);
client.disconnect();
```

## Test

Run the project in IntelliJ IEDA, we can see the output information as follows. The client has successfully connected to the MQTT broker. After the connection was disconnected, the received message was printed through the callback function.
