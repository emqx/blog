## Introduction

[MQTT over QUIC](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/getting-started-with-mqtt-over-quic-from-scratch), introduced by the world’s leading open-source distributed [MQTT broker, EMQX 5.0](https://www.emqx.io/), combines the advantages of the [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) with the characteristics of [QUIC](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/quic-protocol-the-features-use-cases-and-impact-for-iot-iov). By leveraging QUIC's low connection overhead and multi-path support, MQTT over QUIC offers a promising solution to improve user experience in weak networks and irregular network paths. It can address connection interruptions and slow establishment in IoT scenarios such as connected vehicles operating in challenging environments like mountainous areas or tunnels.

With the continuous development of cloud native, more and more users deploy EMQX clusters on Kubernetes to enjoy the rapid creation and convenient management. This article will introduce how to deploy EMQX clusters on Kubernetes and enable MQTT over QUIC.

## Expose EMQX Service

When deploying EMQX on Kubernetes, you can use `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` to expose EMQX service to clients outside the cluster. 

- The `LoadBalancer` method relies on the cloud vendor's load balancer to provide services. Currently, the cloud vendor's load balancer does not support the address migration feature of QUIC. 
- The `NodePort` method relies on [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) component of Kubernetes to forward external requests, which can seamlessly connect to EMQX services and supports the QUIC address migration feature. 

In the scenario of the Internet of Vehicles, the address of the vehicle end may change frequently, and the address migration feature of QUIC is particularly important. Therefore, when deploying EMQX 5.0 on Kubernetes with MQTT over QUIC, we'd better choose to expose services outside the cluster in the form of `NodePort`. 

Next, we will introduce the detailed process of deploying EMQX 5.0 on Kubernetes with MQTT over QUIC . At the same time, we will provide a test sample of exposing services in the form of `NodePort` and QUIC address migration verification.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying EMQX 5.0 on Kubernetes, make sure the following requirements are satisfied:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/): version >= 1.24

  >Due to the bug of [IPVS break UDP NodePort Services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/113802) when kube-proxy in ipvs mode processes UDP packets, UDP packets are discarded, so When deploying Kubernetes, we recommend using kube-proxy in iptables mode. This bug has been fixed in K8s 1.27, please refer to: [Syncing IPVS conntrack cleaning with IPTables](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116171).

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/): version >= 3

## Install EMQX Operator

1. Install and start `cert-manager`.

   `cert-manager `version `1.1.6`  or higher is required. Skip this step if the  `cert-manager`  is already installed and started.

   ```
   $ helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm upgrade --install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
     --namespace cert-manager \
     --create-namespace \
     --set installCRDs=true
   ```

   Or you can follow the [cert-manager installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) to install it.

2. Install EMQX Operator by Helm.

   ```
   $ helm repo add emqx https://repos.emqx.io/charts
   $ helm repo update
   $ helm install emqx-operator emqx/  emqx-operator --namespace emqx-operator-system --create-namespace
   ```

3. Wait till EMQX Operator is ready.

   ```
   $ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pods -l "control-plane=controller-manager" -n emqx-operator-system
   
   # If you get output results similar to the following, it indicates that emqx-operator is ready:
   pod/emqx-operator-controller-manager-57bd7b8bd4-h2mcr condition met
   ```

## Deploy EMQX 5.0 With MQTT over QUIC

1. Save the following as a YAML file and deploy it with the `kubectl apply` command.

   ```
   apiVersion: apps.emqx.io/v2alpha1
   kind: EMQX
   metadata:
     name: emqx
   spec:
     image: emqx:5.0
     bootstrapConfig: |
       listeners.quic.default {
         enabled = true 
         bind = "0.0.0.0:14567"
         max_connections = 1024000
         keyfile = "/opt/emqx/etc/certs/key.pem"
         certfile = "/opt/emqx/etc/certs/cert.pem"
       }
     coreTemplate:
       spec:
         replicas: 3
     replicantTemplate:
       spec:
         replicas: 3
     listenersServiceTemplate:
       spec:
         type: NodePort
         ports:
           - name: quic-default 
             protocol: UDP
             port: 14567
             targetPort: 14567
   ```

   `listeners.quic.default` means to enable the QUIC listener and bind the UDP `14567` port.

2. Wait till EMQX cluster is ready. You can check the status of EMQX cluster through the `kubectl get` command and please make sure that `STATUS` is `Running`. This may take some time.

   ```
   $ kubectl get emqx
   NAME   IMAGE      STATUS    AGE
   emqx   emqx:5.0   Running   10m
   ```

3. Obtain Listener Service of EMQX Cluster.

   EMQX Operator will create two EMQX Service resources, one is `emqx-dashboard` and the other is `emqx-listeners`, corresponding to EMQX console and EMQX listening port respectively.

   ```
   $ kubectl get service emqx-listeners 
   NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                          AGE
   emqx-listeners   NodePort   192.168.50.64   <none>        14567:30171/UDP,1883:32633/TCP   2m1s
   ```

You can see that the QUIC listener is enabled in the service.

## Test QUIC With eMQTT-Bench

[eMQTT-Bench](https://github.com/emqx/emqtt-bench) is a lightweight MQTT 5.0 benchmark tool written in Erlang. You can download and install eMQTT-Bench that supports the QUIC protocol for your platform from [eMQTT-Bench release](https://github.com/emqx/emqtt-bench/releases).

1. Use QUIC protocol to initiate a connection and subscribe by specifying `--quic` option. Here 10 clients are used to subscribe to `t/test` topic.

   ```
   $ ./emqtt_bench sub --quic -h ${node_ip} -p ${node_port} -t t/test -c 10
   ```

2. Open another terminal, and use QUIC protocol to connect and perform a release test.

   ```
   $ ./emqtt_bench pub --quic -h ${node_ip} -p ${node_port} -t t/test -c 1
   ```

   At this point, you can see the message subscription publishing rate of the subscriber and publisher from the output log of the command line:

   ![Output log](https://assets.emqx.com/images/a6d187493b4bafe9f353f99b010ad6a6.png)

3. Test address migration.

   We switch the client network from the time point indicated by the arrow in the figure, and observe the sending and receiving of EMQX cluster messages as shown in the figure below:

   ![Test address migration](https://assets.emqx.com/images/6bb1a933e1dbea73d22c78df8cc9e2cf.png)

   It can be seen from the above figure that QUIC has no effect on message receiving and sending when the client network changes. At the same time, the client publishes and subscribes to messages without any impact, as shown in the following figure:

   ![Client publishes and subscribes to messages without any impact](https://assets.emqx.com/images/664a3d614b513e0032071ad9f7d245d7.png)

## Challenges in Using QUIC on Kubernetes

There are currently two major problems in using the QUIC protocol on Kubernetes: 

1. The cloud vendor LoadBalancer has limited support for the QUIC protocol, such as not supporting IETF QUIC protocol and QUIC address migration feature.
2. When using `NodePort` to expose QUIC services outside the cluster, if kube-proxy adopts the ipvs mode, it will trigger the bug of kube-proxy, causing UDP packets to be discarded, thus causing the EMQX QUIC service to be unavailable.

## Conclusion

The above is the initial experience of MQTT over QUIC on Kubernetes with EMQX 5.0. It can be seen that deploying EMQX 5.0 on Kubernetes is very simple, with only one YAML file needed. After enabling MQTT over QUIC, your device can communicate with the EMQX cluster based on QUIC protocol and take advantage of its benefits for IoT messaging.
