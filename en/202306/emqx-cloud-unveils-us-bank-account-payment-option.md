## Introduction

[EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud) has always been dedicated to providing you with a seamless user experience. From our powerful MQTT service solutions to exceptional customer support, we continually seek ways to improve our services. One vital aspect we focus on is ensuring a flexible payment experience that aligns with your preferences and needs. Today, we are thrilled to introduce a new payment method, ACH Debit Payment, allowing users to use US Bank Account directly to pay for EMQX Cloud services.

## What is ACH Debit Payment 

ACH stands for Automated Clearing House. It is a secure and convenient method for transferring funds directly from a user's US bank account to pay for goods or services, such as EMQX Cloud bills. This payment option leverages the Automated Clearing House network, a reliable electronic funds transfer system in the United States.

## Benefits and Limitations of Using ACH Debit  

By offering ACH Debit payments, EMQX Cloud aims to provide users with a seamless and hassle-free payment experience, allowing them to manage their bills effortlessly while enjoying the benefits of a trusted and widely used payment system. ACH Debit payments offer several advantages, including:

- **Convenience**: Users can pay their EMQX Cloud bills directly from their US bank account and only have to give the bank details once to get started.
- **Security**: ACH Debit payments utilize secure channels and encryption protocols, protecting sensitive banking information.
- **Lower Transaction Fees**: ACH transactions typically have lower fees than other payment methods, enabling cost savings for both EMQX Cloud and its users.

There are also some limitations:

- ACH Debit is only supported by the US Banks system and can not be supported by the other country and region’s banks.
- ACH transactions require an amount of time for processing. It may take from 4 to 7 business days to receive confirmation regarding the success or failure of a payment.

## How to Use ACH Debit Payment in EMQX Cloud
