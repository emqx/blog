We're excited to announce a new EMQX Cloud release focused on expanding platform and regional availability, giving IoT teams more flexibility in how and where they deploy their MQTT infrastructure.

This release brings two major updates:

- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is now supported** for EMQX Cloud Dedicated Flex deployments
- **A new Google Cloud region in Canada (Toronto)** is now available, addressing data residency and compliance needs for North American customers

Together, these updates further strengthen EMQX Cloud’s position as a truly multi-cloud, global MQTT data platform.

## EMQX Cloud Now Supports Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

EMQX Cloud now officially supports deployment on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**.

With this release, Dedicated Flex Plan users can deploy a fully managed, single-tenant EMQX Broker directly on Oracle Cloud, without the operational overhead of self-managing infrastructure.

At launch, the following OCI regions are available:

- **US East:** Ashburn (`us-ashburn-1`)
- **Europe:** Frankfurt (`eu-frankfurt-1`)

### Why OCI Support Matters for IoT Teams

EMQX Cloud is the first and only independent MQTT data platform provider offering a fully managed service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

For IoT teams already standardized on OCI, this means:

- No need to compromise on cloud strategy or migrate data across providers
- Native deployment aligned with existing Oracle Cloud networking, security, and compliance practices
- A fully managed MQTT broker with enterprise-grade reliability, scalability, and observability

Oracle Cloud is widely adopted in industries such as manufacturing, energy, telecommunications, and enterprise IT, where performance predictability and compliance are critical. With OCI support, EMQX Cloud gives Oracle-centric IoT developers a first-class MQTT platform, without added operational complexity.

## New Google Cloud Region: Toronto, Canada

This release also adds a new deployment option on **Google Cloud Platform**:

**Toronto** (`northamerica-northeast2`)

### Designed for Data Residency and Compliance

The new GCP Canada region helps customers:

- Meet data residency requirements by keeping data within Canada
- Reduce latency for Canadian and Northern U.S. users
- Align with regional compliance and regulatory policies

For organizations operating in or serving the Canadian market, this provides a clean and compliant option for running MQTT workloads on Google Cloud.

## One Platform Across All Major Clouds

With this release, EMQX Cloud continues to expand its multi-cloud footprint across:

- **AWS**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Google Cloud**
- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**

All while offering the same core benefits:

- Fully managed, production-ready MQTT clusters
- Flexible deployment models
- High availability, security, and enterprise-grade support
- Seamless integration with downstream data and cloud services
