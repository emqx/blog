MQTTX 1.10.1 is now available!

This release focuses on enhancing the user experience with several key updates. The highlight is the one-click installation for MQTTX CLI via the Desktop application. Additionally, we've added support for custom AI Copilot API, built-in Moonshot LLM API support for Chinese users, and migrated the web client to a new address. These updates aim to make MQTTX more functional and user-friendly for everyone.

## One-Click MQTTX CLI Installation

Starting from v1.10.1, the MQTTX desktop client supports one-click installation for the MQTTX CLI tool. Users can automate the setup process through a user-friendly graphical interface, avoiding manual downloads and configurations. This feature ensures that the latest version of the MQTTX CLI is easily accessible.

**Installation Steps:**

1. Navigate to the settings page, find the MQTTX CLI section, and click the install button.
2. Select the 'Install MQTTX CLI' option from the top menu.
3. The client will automatically download and install the required package for your system. You might need to enter a password to grant installation permissions.
4. After installation, the `mqttx` command will be ready from any terminal.

> **Note:** After clicking install, Windows users need to manually download the MQTTX CLI executable file and use it in the corresponding directory.

## Support for Custom AI Copilot API

In previous versions, MQTTX Copilot was limited to using the built-in OpenAI API. 

Starting from v1.10.1, we have updated this strategy to allow users to customize the AI service API endpoint and models. As long as the API follows the OpenAI format, MQTTX Copilot can support various generative AI LLMs. This flexibility enables users to input their API key, host API, and supported models, integrating various AI services and providing enhanced, personalized AI capabilities within MQTTX. Users can easily switch between AI providers and models, tailoring the Copilot to their needs and preferences.

This feature is made possible thanks to a community contribution from [@ni00](https://github.com/ni00).

## Migration of MQTTX Web Address

We have once again migrated the MQTTX Web online address to [https://mqttx.app/web-client](https://mqttx.app/web-client) to enhance security and compliance. 

**Impact:**

- WebSocket connections must now use Secure WebSocket (wss://) instead of ws://.
- Users need to update their WebSocket connection configurations.

**Solution:**

- Download the MQTTX Desktop or CLI version.
- Consider private deployment of the web client.

For detailed information, please refer to our [migration announcement](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqttx-web-migration-announcement#why-migrate).

Additionally, we have added a data collection policy. If you have any concerns about data collection, please view the details on the About page.

## Specify the Default Protocol in Config Files

MQTTX now allows users to set default protocols in the configuration files. Users can choose protocols like WebSocket (ws, wss) or MQTT over SSL (mqtts) as defaults, eliminating the need to specify them for each connection.

To configure, use the `mqttx init` command and select your preferred default protocol.

This feature is made possible thanks to a community contribution from [@rpendleton](https://github.com/rpendleton).
