MQTT, designed initially as a lightweight [publish/subscribe messaging protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-5-introduction-to-publish-subscribe-model), is now becoming essential for Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 4.0. Its significance lies in facilitating the seamless connection between diverse industrial devices and the cloud, enabling the convergence of Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT).

This article compares the top 3 MQTT brokers for IIoT in 2023, including each broker's advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. It also shows how you can leverage the features of these 3 MQTT brokers to build a Unified Namespace (UNS) architecture for your IIoT solution.

## At a Glance: 3 Outstanding Projects

We select the top [open-source MQTT brokers](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/a-comprehensive-comparison-of-open-source-mqtt-brokers-in-2023) for industrial IoT based on these two criteria:

- Community, popularity, and project activity of the open source projects.
- Compatibility with resource-constrained industrial devices and gateways.

Based on the criteria, we choose the 3 popular open-source MQTT brokers:

- **EMQX**: The most starred MQTT broker on GitHub, with 11.4k stars. EMQX has a booting footprint of 50M and supports clustering capabilities.
- **Mosquitto**: The second-most-starred but the most prevalent among MQTT brokers. In a single-threaded architecture, Mosquitto has a booting footprint of less than 1M.
- **NanoMQ**: The latest and one of the most active MQTT brokers available. With multi-threading and async-io support, NanoMQ has a startup space of about 2M.

Here is a summary of the 3 projects hosted on GitHub:

## Optimize Broker Deployment for IIoT Projects

Unified Namespace (UNS) is a solution architecture built on the MQTT broker for Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0. It provides a unified namespace for [MQTT topics](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/advanced-features-of-mqtt-topics) and a centralized repository for messages and structured data. 

The 3 MQTT brokers can work together to build the UNS architecture. A cohesive system is created by deploying Mosquitto and NanoMQ on industrial gateways while deploying EMQX as a centralized hub in the cloud. This configuration allows for the seamless aggregation and ingestion of IIoT data from the edge to the cloud via MQTT bridges.

## Conclusion

Based on the earlier introduction and comparison, each MQTT broker offers distinct strengths for different deployment scenarios. [EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/) is highly scalable with enterprise features, suitable for cloud deployment. [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and [NanoMQ](https://nanomq.io/) are fast and lightweight, ideal for industrial gateways.

These three MQTT brokers play a significant role in industrial IoT applications, leading the way in implementing the UNS architecture and facilitating the convergence of IT and OT domains. When considering your specific IIoT projects, you can choose one or two of these MQTT brokers based on your requirements. By leveraging their strengths, you can create a cohesive system where the MQTT brokers work together, synergizing their capabilities.
