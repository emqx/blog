## Introduction

[Neuron](https://neugates.io/) is an industry IoT gateway software that enables industrial devices with essential IoT connectivity capabilities. With minimal resource utilization, Neuron can communicate with diverse industrial devices through the standard or its dedicated protocols, realizing the multiple device connections to the Industrial IoT platform. 

To enable users to verify their [IIoT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/iiot-explained-examples-technologies-benefits-and-challenges) systems more easily, Neuron v2.4.4 provides a time-unlimited free trial license. Users can now experience the full connectivity capabilities of Neuron at no cost from this version.

## Various Drivers Available for Industrial Connectivity

Neuron is an open-source project that embraces collaboration and community contribution. The core framework, dashboard, and a selection of driver modules, including widely-used Modbus-TCP and MQTT, are available as open source under the LGPLv3 license. 

For those who demand more dedicated protocol connectivity, Neuron provides a range of commercial drivers catering to various industrial and common PLC protocols. These drivers include [BACnet](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/bacnet-protocol-basic-concepts-structure-obejct-model-explained), KNXnet/IP, IEC-104, IEC-61850, Mitsubishi 1E and 3E, Siemens S7 and Fetch-write, Omron Fins TCP, Beckhoff ADS, and more. With these drivers, Neuron ensures seamless integration of various industrial devices and facilitates data communication and management. 

## Try Any Drivers For As Long As You Want

Previously, users needed to download from EMQ official website or contact us directly to obtain a trial license for Neuron, limited to 1000 data tags, 100 connections, and 15 days. It was insufficient for many developers to thoroughly test and verify their work with commercial drivers. 

The latest release offers an embedded, time-unlimited free trial license with a 30-data tag limitation. All you need to do is to download the latest version of Neuron's docker images or installation package and start using it immediately!
