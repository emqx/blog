In this green solution, EMQ mainly collects and pre-processes the overall energy consumption and carbon emission data on the device side and transmits them to the cloud as the access and gateway layers. The analysis and prediction layer & storage layer of AWS based on the underlying sensor architecture is responsible for subsequent data storage, statistics, analysis and prediction, so as to provide reliable carbon-neutral data support for enterprises jointly. The solution was unveiled at the 2021 AWS China Summit in Shanghai in July and received great attention from the on-site audience.

### Accelerate the cloud era, foresee the future

Up to now, more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies and most Fortune 500 companies in the world are using the solutions and services provided by AWS partners. The addition of EMQ will absolutely bring more possibilities for the IoT innovation business of these companies.
