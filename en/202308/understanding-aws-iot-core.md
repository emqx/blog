## What Is AWS IoT Core?

AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices interact with cloud applications and other devices. It can support a large volume of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely.

AWS IoT Core makes it possible to build applications that act on the data generated by connected devices. These applications can be hosted in the cloud, which enables web-based access to these services, thus enhancing the scalability, accessibility, and maintenance of IoT systems.

AWS IoT Core is particularly useful in IoT use cases where devices need to communicate with each other and the cloud, but do not have the ability to directly interact with backend services. AWS IoT Core acts as the communication hub between these devices and the backend services, handling all the complexities of concurrent communication, message routing, security, authorization, and error handling.

## 6 Key Features of AWS IoT Core

### 1. Device Communication: MQTT, HTTP, and WebSocket Protocols

One of the critical aspects of any IoT service is the communication protocol. AWS IoT Core supports three main protocols: MQTT, HTTP, and WebSocket. [MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. HTTP and WebSockets are standard web protocols that devices can use to send and receive data from AWS IoT Core.

The support for these protocols ensures that your devices can communicate with AWS IoT Core, irrespective of their capabilities or the network conditions. This feature is crucial in creating versatile, resilient IoT systems that can function seamlessly under varying conditions.

### 2. Security and Identity Service: Authentication and Encryption

Robust security and identity services ensure that all device data is transmitted securely and that unauthorized devices or applications cannot connect to your devices. AWS IoT Core uses mutual authentication and encryption at all points of connection, ensuring data is never exchanged between devices and AWS IoT Core without proven identity.

Moreover, AWS provides fine-grained access control to your IoT resources using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This ensures your resources are accessible only to authenticated users or devices with the necessary permissions.

### 3. Device Shadow: Storing and Retrieving Device State

The Device Shadow feature in AWS IoT Core is a JSON document used to store and retrieve the current state of a device. This document enables applications to read from and write to the fields of the device shadow, providing a reliable way to track the device's state over time. This means even if your device is offline, you can set a desired future state, and the device will synchronize when it reconnects.

### 4. Rules Engine: Processing and Routing of IoT Data

The Rules Engine is a service within AWS IoT Core that enables data processing and routing from IoT devices. The engine evaluates inbound messages published into AWS IoT Core and transforms and delivers them to another device or a cloud service, based on business rules you define.

With the Rules Engine, you can filter, transform, and act upon device data on the fly, based on business rules you define. You can route the data to AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon SNS, and many others.

### 5. Registry: Organize and Index Devices

The Registry in AWS IoT Core allows you to categorize devices into a hierarchical structure based on function, security requirements, or any other category that fits your needs. The Registry also enables you to track metadata such as device attributes and capabilities.

### 6. Device Defender: IoT Device Security

Finally, the Device Defender is a security feature in AWS IoT Core that continuously monitors your fleet of devices for abnormal behavior. It lets you maintain and enforce IoT configurations such as device identity, authentication, and access control, ensuring your devices remain compliant with security policies.

After you enter the command from Step 2 in the console, you should see an output in the device's terminal or command window that indicates the program is sending messages to AWS IoT Core and then receiving messages back.

From the **Test** page of the AWS IoT console, open the MQTT test client. If you chose Python SDK, then in the MQTT test client, in the **Topic** filter, enter a topic to subscribe to messages from the device. For example, you can use the topic sdk/test/python. The topic filters are case sensitive.

After you subscribe to the test topic, run ./start.sh on your device. Immediately afterwards, messages should appear in the MQTT client, similar to this:

```
{
  "message": "Hello World!" [1]
}  
```

 Click **Continue** to finish the tutorial and see a summary of the activity.
