## Introduction

After its successful launch on AWS Marketplace and Google Marketplace, we are excited to announce that [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud) is now available on Azure Marketplace with a convenient pay-as-you-go mode. Users can now easily subscribe to EMQX Cloud services through the Azure marketplace and leverage Azure for seamless billing management and efficient resource control.

## Benefits of Subscribing From Azure Marketplace

As a fully managed MQTT cloud service covering various regions on mainstream cloud platforms, [EMQX Cloud Dedicated](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud/dedicated) offers the flexibility to be deployed across multiple regions within Microsoft Azure. Establishing peering between EMQX Cloud and other Azure resources is a straightforward process, making it exceptionally convenient for users who have already deployed their infrastructure resources on Azure to manage all billing seamlessly under their Microsoft Azure account.

Subscribing to EMQX Cloud from Azure Marketplace enables users to effortlessly manage charges and bills within the Azure environment. The subscription can be easily modified or canceled at any time, providing the freedom to adapt as needed. With the pay-as-you-go mode, users can access the majority of EMQX Cloud's features without a credit card required, simplifying the process of acquiring a fully managed MQTT service with just a few clicks.
