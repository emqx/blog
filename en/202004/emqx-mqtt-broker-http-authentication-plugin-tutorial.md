Before reading this tutorial, we suppose that you already known some basic [MQTT](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html) and [EMQX MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en) knowledge.



[emqx_auth_http](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-auth-http/) will throw authentication and access control event for each **MQTT client** to the user's own *WebServer*, to implement authentication and ACL. The architecture logic is:

![emqx_auth_http.png](https://static.emqx.net/images/cf59952934faf013fe1b1c5c74c5e01b.png)

**The events that `emqx_auth_http` mainly process are :**

1. Authentication: Whenever the MQTT client receives a CONNECT request, [EMQX MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en) will fill the parameter (such as ClientId, Username, and Password, etc) brought by the client to the HTTP parameter, and then will initiate a request to the Web Services the user-configured themselves. If successful request, allowing this MQTT client to connect.
2. ACL: Whenever the MQTT client implements the PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE operation, EMQX will fill the parameter (such as ClientId and topic, etc) to the HTTP parameter, and then will initiate an ACL request to the Web Services the user-configured themselves. If successful request, allowing this PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE.

Actually, in the EMQX cluster, emqx_auth_http is just a simple and stateless HTTP Client for the user's  Web Service. emqx_auth_http only sends the internal EMQX login authentication and ACL control requests to the user's Web Services, and did some logic processing.

## Introduction to the plugin configuration items

The following content list the default configuration file of this plugin 3.1.0, although  there is a lot of content, only configured three HTTP Request parameters. 

- MQTT client access authentication(auth_req)
- Judging whether is a superuser(super_req)
- ACL request(acl_req)

We will take the authentication as an example. Every configuration item represents:

| Configuration Item        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| auth.http.auth_req        | configuring the URL path address the auth_req request needs  |
| auth.http.auth_req.method | configuring the HTTP Method the auth_req uses,  only support GET/POST/PUT |
| auth.http.auth_req.params | configuring parameter list of auth_req request               |

As for params item, it supports various parameter placeholders. The comment of the configuration file included the meanings of the placeholder. For example:  

```shell
auth.http.auth_req.params = clientid=%c,username=%u,password=%P
```

It means that the auth_req includes three parameters. The keys of these three parameters are `clientid`,  `username` and `password` respectively. When accessing the client, the values of these keys will be replaced by the real values of `ClientId`,  `Username`, and  `Password`.



All default configurations are:

```shell
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Authentication request.
##
## Variables:
##  - %u: username
##  - %c: clientid
##  - %a: ipaddress
##  - %P: password
##  - %cn: common name of client TLS cert
##  - %dn: subject of client TLS cert
##
## Value: URL
auth.http.auth_req = http://127.0.0.1:8991/mqtt/auth
## Value: post | get | put
auth.http.auth_req.method = post
## Value: Params
auth.http.auth_req.params = clientid=%c,username=%u,password=%P

##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Superuser request.
##
## Variables:
##  - %u: username
##  - %c: clientid
##  - %a: ipaddress
##
## Value: URL
auth.http.super_req = http://127.0.0.1:8991/mqtt/superuser
## Value: post | get | put

## Value: Params
auth.http.super_req.params = clientid=%c,username=%u


##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## ACL request.
##
## Variables:
##  - %A: 1 | 2, 1 = sub, 2 = pub
##  - %u: username
##  - %c: clientid
##  - %a: ipaddress
##  - %t: topic
##
## Value: URL
auth.http.acl_req = http://127.0.0.1:8991/mqtt/acl
## Value: post | get | put
auth.http.acl_req.method = get
## Value: Params
auth.http.acl_req.params = access=%A,username=%u,clientid=%c,ipaddr=%a,topic=%t
```



## How to return 

After understanding how to configure the `emqx_auth_http` plugin, the rest key thing is how to let the *Webserver* returning succeeded or failed. 

#### Authentication

Authentication successed:

```
HTTP Status Code: 200
```

Ignore this authentication:

```
HTTP Status Code: 200
Body: ignore
```

Error:

```
HTTP Status Code: Except 200
```

#### The super user

Confirmed super user:

```
HTTP Status Code: 200
```

Non-super user:

```
HTTP Status Code: Except 200
```

#### ACL authentication

Allow PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBEï¼š

```
HTTP Status Code: 200
```

Ignore this authentication: 

```
HTTP Status Code: 200
Body: ignore
```

Refuse this PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE:

```
HTTP Status Code: Except 200
```
