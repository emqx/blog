## Introduction

In the era of rapid Internet of Things (IoT) advancement, the [MQTT protocol](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) has become an integral component for numerous companies and developers. The utilization of MQTT client tools has become commonplace, facilitating seamless connections to [MQTT brokers](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-mqtt-broker-comparison) for various functions such as publishing, subscribing, and exchanging messages.

Selecting the right tool is paramount for developers seeking to delve into MQTT features and streamline the debugging process of IoT applications, ultimately reducing the development cycle. The plethora of available MQTT client tools, each with distinct functional focuses, presents a challenge for developers when deciding on the most suitable option.

This blog curates a list of seven of the most valuable MQTT client tools for the year 2024. Organized into Desktop, Browser, Command Line, and Mobile categories, this selection aims to assist you in swiftly identifying the ideal tool for your MQTT development endeavors.

## How to Choose an MQTT Client?

A good MQTT client tool should possess the following key features.

- Support for one-way and two-way SSL authentication.
- Support for [MQTT 5](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introduction-to-mqtt-5) features.
- Maintain ease of use on a full-featured basis.
- Support for multiple clients online at the same time.
- Cross-platform, available under different operating systems.
- Support MQTT over WebSocket.
- Advanced features: Customized script, logging, payload format conversion, etc.

## Prerequisite: Prepare an MQTT Broker

Before diving into the MQTT desktop tools, we need an [MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.io/) to communicate and test. We choose the free public MQTT broker available on `broker.emqx.io`.

> **MQTT Broker Info**
>
> - Server: broker.emqx.io
> - TCP Port: 1883
> - WebSocket Port: 8083
> - SSL/TLS Port: 8883
> - Secure WebSocket Port: 8084

#### Installation

MQTTX CLI is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. For additional installation options, please consult the [documentation](https://mqttx.app/docs/cli/downloading-and-installation).

- **Docker**

  ```
  docker pull emqx/mqttx-cli
  docker run -it --rm emqx/mqttx-cli
  ```

- **Homebrew**

  ```
  brew install emqx/mqttx/mqttx-cli
  ```

- **Download**

  [https://mqttx.app/cli](https://mqttx.app/cli)

#### Usage Example

- Connect

  Test connecting to an MQTT broker:

  ```
  mqttx conn -h 'broker.emqx.io' -p 1883 -u 'test' -P 'test'
  ```

- **Subscribe**

  Subscribe to an [MQTT topic](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/advanced-features-of-mqtt-topics):

  ```
  mqttx sub -t 'topic/#' -h 'broker.emqx.io' -p 1883
  ```

- **Publish**

  Publish a QoS1 message to an MQTT topic:

  ```
  mqttx pub -t 'topic' -q 1 -h 'broker.emqx.io' -p 1883 -m 'Hello from MQTTX CLI'
  ```

- **Publishing multiple messages**

  The MQTTX CLI also supports publishing multiple messages. Add a -M parameter and a -s parameter to the command in the editor, and newline it after each entry.

  ![MQTTX CLI](https://assets.emqx.com/images/549a31f8b062f099c0eac8c0c6047f35.png)

- **Benchmark**

  For MQTTX CLI, the `bench` command is easy to use and concise in its content output. For a large number of connections, subscriptions, and publications, the display method has been optimized by dynamically updating the real-time numbers to avoid being overwhelmed by a large number of output logs during use.
