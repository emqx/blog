## MQTTX CLI - Debug Mode

The Debug Mode in MQTTX 1.9.8, powered by MQTT.js, streamlines MQTT debugging. Activated with the `--debug` switch, it provides real-time logs during connection, publishing, and subscribing, detailing client configurations and packet handling. This feature is invaluable for developers to understand and troubleshoot MQTT protocols effectively.

Consider the command `mqttx conn -h broker.emqx.io -p 1883 --debug` as an example of the new Debug Mode. This command initiates a detailed MQTT debug process, revealing logs like:

- Connection initiation to MQTT broker.
- Client settings include protocol version, keepalive, and client ID.
- Stream setup and handling for MQTT communication.
- Packet sending processes like `connect` and `pingreq`.
- Real-time monitoring of MQTT interactions, including packet handling and response checks.

These details aid in understanding the MQTT communication lifecycle, from establishing connections to maintaining them, which is crucial for troubleshooting and advanced MQTT usage.

- **Message Sending Optimization**: Introduce quicker message sending with the Enter key and line breaks with Shift + Enter.

- **Effective Troubleshooting with Connection Info**: Leverage connection data for more efficient problem-solving, streamlining the troubleshooting process within MQTT environments.

- **Enhanced MQTT FAQ Prompts**: Include additional preset MQTT FAQ prompts, offering users better guidance and understanding of MQTTX functionalities.

## Others

- **Connection Management Optimization**:
  - Replace `chart.js` with `echart` to enhance the display of traffic statistics, offering improved visualizations.
  - Address the issue of sending empty authentication information, providing a temporary solution.
    - Known issue: In the MQTT-v5 protocol, the MQTT-packet library incorrectly requires a username when a password is set, contrary to MQTT-v5's allowance for password-only authentication. Thanks to [JimMoen](https://github.com/JimMoen) for the fix: [mqtt-packet PR #148](https://github.com/mqttjs/mqtt-packet/pull/148)
- **OpenAI API**: Adjust the temperature value in the OpenAI API for more accurate Copilot responses.

## Roadmap
