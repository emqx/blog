Since its release, [EMQ X Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud) has been adhering to the concept of allowing users at home and abroad to have a fully managed [MQTT messaging](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) service with one click, and has been gradually expanded on cloud platforms and deployment regions. At present, EMQ X Cloud supports deployment in China(Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen) and other three regions of Asia Pacific (Singapore, Mumbai), the United States (Virginia, Oregon), and Europe (Ireland, Frankfurt).

> Note: Some regions are only available in the professional plan.

With the continuous increase of worldwide customers, in order to meet the needs of multi-regional deployment, we have decided to add deployment support  **for the basic plan** in Europe (Frankfurt) in addition to the current deployment support in the regions of Asia Pacific (Singapore) and the United States (Virginia).

## Lower latency

If your target customer is in Europe and you choose to deploy in Shanghai, your customer may need some means to access your service, and it is likely to be stuck. This will result in a poor experience for your customers.

Obviously, the closer the deployment region is to the target user, the better the network quality will be guaranteed. The user's access speed will be improved as a result. For customers who need to develop their business in Europe,  EMQ X Cloud that adds deployment support in Frankfurt will undoubtedly bring convenience to their business.


## More convenient integration experience

If your company's business or device is located in Europe, the new EMQ x Cloud basic plan deployed in Europe will help you connect with existing businesses or devices more easily and obtain a better experience at a lower cost.


## Comply with GDPR data requirements

Users with European businesses may understand this. If you need to deploy some business involving user data in Europe, you'd better choose to deploy locally in Europe to store some user-related data.
