## Overview

While the societal trend leans towards substituting traditional energy sources with more renewable options, challenges arise from the intermittent and variable nature of outputs from sources like solar and wind energy. The unpredictable highs and lows of renewable energy make it challenging to maintain a stable and consistent power supply on the electrical grid. Consequently, many power suppliers are considering constructing large-scale energy storage systems to optimize the management and utilization of these smart energy sources.

EMQ offers a unified [MQTT platform](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-platform-essential-features-and-use-cases) for power suppliers by facilitating intelligent smart energy battery storage systems. It addresses critical issues such as data collection, analysis, transmission, and storage, ensuring the stable and efficient operation of energy systems.

## Challenges of Building an Smart Energy Storage System

Power suppliers typically employ a containerized storage approach to establish an intelligent operational system for large-scale battery energy storage. This is more than just a straightforward energy storage device; it's a sophisticated system encompassing various functional modules, such as battery module management, energy management, air conditioning control, fire safety management, and energy resource management. The complexity of such a system demands efficient, reliable, and intelligent management methods to ensure its stable operation.

EMQ empowers the construction of an smart energy storage system through the following aspects:

- **Efficient Data Collection**: NeuronEX gateway collects data from diverse devices at high frequency. It rapidly gathers data from over 10,000 container storage points in just 100ms for safe energy storage system operations. 
- **Low-Latency Edge Computing**: NeuronEX offers an edge computing framework for battery energy storage systems, reducing latency to the millisecond level. This is achieved through SQL statements and function extensions, enabling features such as modeling analysis of State of Charge (SoC) / State of Health (SoH), battery module consistency calculation, predictive warning, data encoding compression, and real-time database storage at the edge.
- **System Interconnection**: The interconnection of power systems requires bidirectional communication based on higher-level secure communication technology. EMQ provides communication solutions for both forward and reverse gateways, helping battery energy storage enterprises achieve energy system interconnection in compliance with power safety standards.
- **Decoupling of Multi-System:** In energy storage backend systems, various subsystems have different requirements for throughput and latency. With streaming data persistence and processing capabilities, HStream platforms can help decouple different backend systems. This means that streaming data producers and consumers of data can operate independently, enhancing the overall flexibility and maintainability of the system.

## The Advantages of EMQX MQTT Platform

- **Massive Device Secure Interconnection**: Achieve real-time collection of high-frequency massive data from large-scale smart energy storage devices, and establish bidirectional communication by the safety specifications required by the power system, ensuring the secure interconnection of system devices.
- **Rapid Response and Stable Maintenance:** Real-time stream computing at the edge reduces latency, enables fault warnings, and ensures stable operation. Besides, smart energy management based on data and algorithms also reduces operational costs.
- **Low-Cost Scalable Construction:** With high scalability and robust integration capabilities, the system can achieve rapid and flexible scaling, seamlessly integrating multiple systems to meet the requirements of large-scale construction.
