### Install and Configure NanoMQ on Edge Devices

1. Download NanoMQ

   Visit the official EMQ website and download the EMQ NanoMQ version suitable for your edge device.

1. Install NanoMQ

   Depending on the operating system of your device, execute the NanoMQ installation program. Typically, this involves extracting the downloaded files and running the installationscript. In this example, we will use the Apt repository to install NanoMQ on a Raspberry Pi.

   ```
   curl -s https://assets.emqx.com/scripts/install-nanomq-deb.sh | sudo bash
   
   sudo apt-get install nanomq
   ```

1. Configure NanoMQ

   To configure NanoMQ bridging, you need to modify the configuration file /etc/NanoMQ_bridge.conf in the default path. In the configuration file, you can specify parameters for the MQTT broker, such as listening ports, authentication settings, and other options, to forward data received on specified topics to EMQX Cloud.

   The configuration parameters are as follows:

   - Remote broker address
   - MQTT protocol version
   - Client identifier (default is automatically assigned by NanoMQ)
   - Session clean
   - Keep Alive
   - Username
   - Password
   - Forwarded Topics (multiple topics separated by commas)
   - QoS level
   - Client concurrency

   In this example, the configuration file is /etc/nanomq_bridge.conf.

   ```
   bridges.mqtt.name {
     ## TCP URL format: mqtt-tcp://host:port
     ## TLS URL format: tls+mqtt-tcp://host:port
     ## QUIC URL format: mqtt-quic://host:port
     server = "mqtt-tcp://x.x.x.x:1883"
     ## MQTT protocol version (4 | 5)
     proto_ver = 4
     username = xxx
     password = xxx
     clean_start = true
     keepalive = 60s
     ## Uncomment the following code if bridging via TLS
     ## ssl {
     ##  keyfile = "/etc/certs/key.pem"
     ##  certfile = "/etc/certs/cert.pem"
     ##  cacertfile = "/etc/certs/cacert.pem"
     ## }
     forwards = [
       {
         remote_topic = "temp_hum/emqx"
         local_topic = "temp_hum/emqx"
         qos = 0
       }
     ]
     max_parallel_processes = 2
     max_send_queue_len = 1024
     max_recv_queue_len = 1024
   }
   ```

1. Start NanoMQ

   Launch NanoMQ using the startup script or command. Once initiated, NanoMQ will begin listening on the specified port and be ready to accept MQTT connections.

   ```
   nanomq start --conf /etc/nanomq_bridge.conf
   ```

   ![nanomq start](https://assets.emqx.com/images/5237803dfc69473b9a930200f53c30b4.png)

### Verify the Installation and Functionality of NanoMQ

To verify the installation and functionality of NanoMQ, you can perform the following actions:

1. **Connect to NanoMQ**

   Use MQTT client tools such as MQTTX or mosquitto_sub/mosquitto_pub to connect to NanoMQ.

   ![Connect to NanoMQ](https://assets.emqx.com/images/62ca99c01ef094145e313d35b02d9603.png)

2. **Publish and Subscribe Messages**

   Publish a message and ensure that it can be successfully delivered to subscribers. This can validate the agent's message delivery functionality.

   ![Publish and Subscribe Messages](https://assets.emqx.com/images/89892cc370eaa9cc82f71ea7c3bfec60.png)

1. **Monitor and Logs** 

   Check NanoMQ's log files to ensure there are no errors or exceptions. This helps ensure the broker is working correctly.

2. **Parallel Query Processing**: ClickHouse can process multiple queries in parallel, enhancing query performance. This is achieved by partitioning data into multiple partitions and simultaneously processing queries on these partitions. This parallel processing capability allows ClickHouse to efficiently handle large-scale datasets.
3. **Support for Complex Data Types**: ClickHouse supports various complex data types, including arrays, tuples, and maps. This flexibility enables it to handle different types of data effectively.
4. **High-Performance Aggregation Functions**: ClickHouse provides a rich set of built-in aggregation functions for performing various statistical and aggregation operations. These optimized aggregation functions can quickly execute on large-scale datasets.
5. **Flexible Storage Engine Support**: ClickHouse features a pluggable storage engine architecture, allowing users to choose different storage engines to meet specific requirements. Support for multiple storage engines enables ClickHouse to be applied flexibly in various scenarios.
6. **Distributed Query Support**: ClickHouse has a distributed architecture, capable of running on multiple nodes and supporting distributed queries. This distributed query capability allows ClickHouse to handle large-scale datasets while maintaining low query latency.
7. **Real-time Data Insertion and Querying**: ClickHouse is not only suitable for batch data processing but also supports fast insertion and querying of real-time data. This makes it suitable for scenarios that require timely analysis and querying of real-time data.

In summary, the characteristics of ClickHouse's query language include high-performance columnar storage and queries, parallel query processing, support for complex data types, rich aggregation functions, flexible storage engine support, and distributed query capabilities, making it a powerful tool for large-scale data analysis.

### **Create a real-time monitoring dashboard**

To achieve real-time monitoring of ClickHouse, we can employ the following methods:

1. **Prometheus and Grafana**

   Integrating Prometheus and Grafana is a widely adopted approach for real-time monitoring of ClickHouse. We can configure Prometheus to collect various metrics from ClickHouse and create intuitive dashboards with Grafana to monitor performance, query speed, and more in real-time.

1. **ClickHouse System Tables**

   ClickHouse provides a series of System tables that contain detailed information about the performance of the ClickHouse cluster. By querying these tables, we can obtain real-time performance and status information. Here are some example queries for retrieving ClickHouse performance metrics:

   ```
   -- Query ClickHouse node status
   SELECT * FROM system.clusters;
   
   -- Query performance of ClickHouse cluster queries
   SELECT * FROM system.query_log;
   
   -- Query size and disk usage of ClickHouse tables
   SELECT * FROM system.parts;
   ```

   Please note that specific query steps may vary depending on the ClickHouse version and cloud service provider. It is recommended to refer to the official ClickHouse documentation for the latest information on using monitoring and dashboard features.

1. **ClickHouse Client Tools**

   ClickHouse provides some command-line tools and web interfaces, such as clickhouse-client and clickhouse-web, which can be used to monitor the status of ClickHouse. These tools offer a comprehensive overview of real-time performance data and cluster status.

1. **Monitoring Tools from Cloud Service Providers**

   In the ClickHouse Cloud control panel, we can utilize monitoring dashboards from cloud service providers to view resource usage related to ClickHouse for specific time periods. Ensure timely access to the latest documentation from your cloud service provider to better leverage its monitoring capabilities.

   ![ClickHouse Cloud control panel](https://assets.emqx.com/images/d25981158894cf950ceb38589a5d47ac.png)

### Data Accuracy and Real-time Validation

1. Data Accuracy Validation
   - **Data Consistency Checks**: Utilize ClickHouse's data consistency checking tools to ensure consistency among data across different nodes.
   - **Integrity Constraints**: Employ appropriate constraints such as primary keys and unique keys in table structures to ensure data integrity.
   - **Data Replay and Comparison**: Regularly replay data and compare the results with the source data to validate data accuracy.

1. Real-time Validation
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Use built-in performance monitoring tools in ClickHouse to monitor query performance, loads, and system resource utilization to ensure real-time performance.
   - **Real-time ETL Processes**: If there are real-time data requirements, consider using streaming ETL tools to rapidly import real-time data into ClickHouse, ensuring timely data updates.
   - **Query Optimization**: Optimize query statements and indexes for real-time queries to enhance query performance.

In summary, although ClickHouse itself is not a traditional real-time data processing engine and focuses on analytical workloads, if there is a high demand for real-time performance, consider combining it with other technologies. For example, integrating streaming processing engines (such as Apache Kafka Streams or Apache Flink) with ClickHouse can meet real-time requirements.
