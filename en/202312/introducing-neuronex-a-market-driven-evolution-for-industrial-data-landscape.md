## From Neuron to NeuronEX

As an industrial gateway, [Neuron](https://github.com/emqx/neuron) can convert various industrial protocols to [MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt). NeuronEX adds analytical features on top of Neuron, offering not only equipment data acquisition but also edge intelligent analysis, especially in the realm of AI/ML. In the ever-evolving field of industrial data management, the evolution from Neuron to NeuronEX is not just a technological leap, but a direct response to valuable customer feedback and real-world deployment and application experience.

## NeuronEX Edge Architecture

NeuronEX, born from the crucible of real-world deployment and customer interactions, introduces a host of advanced capabilities, including streaming processing and data analysis. These enhancements address the dynamic requirements expressed by our customers, providing a solution that goes beyond Neuron gateway to offer real-time insights and intelligent decision-making capabilities at the edge.
