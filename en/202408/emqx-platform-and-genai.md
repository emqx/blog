## Demo Case: Smart Manufacturing Device Monitoring

Next, we'll demonstrate a practical example using EMQX and GenAI to improve manufacturing operations. EMQX will be utilized to create an intelligent factory demo, featuring real-time device monitoring and predictive maintenance capabilities. 

The main components of this demo include:

1. EMQX Platform: Serves as the central messaging platform for receiving and processing real-time IoT data from manufacturing devices.
2. Chroma: The vector database for efficiently storing and retrieving vectorized device data.
3. OpenAI Embedding Model: Used to vectorize device data.
4. OpenAI GPT Model: Employed to generate insights and predictions.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Get a free EMQX Instance on EMQX Platform

We'll first install EMQX Enterprise locally to begin our smart manufacturing demo. EMQX Enterprise is recommended for its rich data integration features, including support for Kafka, RabbitMQ, MySQL, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, and other commonly used databases and stream processing middleware.

You can install EMQX Enterprise using Docker with the following command:

```shell
docker run -d --name emqx-enterprise -p 1883:1883 -p 8083:8083 -p 8084:8084 -p 8883:8883 -p 18083:18083 emqx/emqx-enterprise:5.7.2
```

After installation, access the EMQX Dashboard:

1. Open `<http://<your-host-address>:18083` in your browser
2. Log in using the default username and password

While EMQX doesn't have built-in support for vector database storage and LLM interaction, we can leverage its powerful extension capabilities. We'll use HTTP as a bridge to connect EMQX with our custom RAG server.

#### Step 2: Build a RAG Server

Here's a simplified version of our RAG server using Python and FastAPI. Note that this is only the key part of the code and not a complete implementation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
import chromadb
import openai

app = FastAPI()
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
collection = chroma_client.create_collection("device_data")

openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"  # Replace with your actual API key

@app.post("/process")
async def process_data(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    # Vectorize and store data
    embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=str(data), model="text-embedding-ada-002")
    collection.add(
        embeddings=[embedding['data'][0]['embedding']],
        documents=[str(data)],
        ids=[f"doc_{len(collection.get()['ids'])}"]
    )
    return {"status": "processed"}

class ChatQuery(BaseModel):
    query: str
    system_template: str

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(chat_query: ChatQuery):
    # Perform similarity search and generate response
    embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=chat_query.query, model="text-embedding-ada-002")
    results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[embedding['data'][0]['embedding']], n_results=5)
    context = "\n".join(results['documents'][0])

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": chat_query.system_template},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Context:\n{context}\n\nQuery: {chat_query.query}"}
        ]
    )
    return {"response": response.choices[0].message['content'].strip()}
```

- The `/process` endpoint receives device data, creates an embedding using OpenAI's API, and stores it in the Chroma vector database.
- The `/chat` endpoint takes a query and a system template, finds similar data in the database, and uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate a response based on the retrieved context.

This code provides a basic framework for processing IoT data and generating insights using LLM. Remember to handle errors, implement proper authentication, and optimize for production use.

#### Step 3: Connect EMQX to RAG Server

After starting your RAG server, create an HTTP connector in EMQX:

1. In the EMQX Dashboard, go to **Data Integration** -> **Connector**
2. Click **Create** and choose **HTTP Server**
3. Configure the connector:
   - Name: `RAG_server`
   - The Base URL: `http://your-rag-server-ip:8000`
4. Click **Create** to save the connector

![Create an HTTP connector](https://assets.emqx.com/images/3dcf28eb85030c30d921f373c8b804b1.png)

#### Step 4: Creating a Data Integration Flow in EMQX

To quickly set up data integration for our smart manufacturing scenario, we'll use the Flow Designer in EMQX. Follow these steps to create a flow that filters, extracts, and stores factory data in the vector database:

1. Navigate to **Data Integration** -> **Flow Designer** in the EMQX dashboard.

2. Click on "Create" to start a new flow. Add a description like "store data to vector database".

3. You'll see three main sections in the flow canvas: Source, Processing, and Sink.

4. For the Source:

   - Drag the "Messages" node into the canvas.

   - Configure it to listen to the topic `factory/#` to capture all factory-related messages.

     ![Flow Designer](https://assets.emqx.com/images/45600a98250993d6605e2d35fa588701.png)

5. For Processing:

   - Add a "Data Processing" node and connect it to the Messages source.

   - Configure two fields in the Data Processing node:
     This step extracts the necessary information from the incoming messages.

     ![Data Processing](https://assets.emqx.com/images/ada2d1ee466f5fe5ed3b93fd396bb3ad.png)

6. For the Sink:

   - Add an "HTTP Server" node and connect it to the Data Processing node.

   - Configure the HTTP Server node:

     - Action: store_data_to_chroma

     - Connector: RAG_Server (select the HTTP connector we created earlier)

     - URL Path: /process

     - Method: POST

     - Body: 

       ```json
       {
         "data": ${data},
         "topic": "${original_topic}"
       }
       ```

   This step sends the processed data to our RAG server for vectorization and storage.

   ![Flows](https://assets.emqx.com/images/3aee576e9f7f167a56c883d9a22c02fb.png)

This flow will automatically capture messages from factory topics, process them, and send them to your RAG server for storage in the Chroma vector database.

#### Step 5: Creating a Query Flow in EMQX

Follow these steps to create a flow that queries device status and generates insights using GenAI:

1. Set up the Source:

   - Add a "Messages" node to listen to the topic `query/#`.

     ![Set up the Source](https://assets.emqx.com/images/b8bcc21eac53e979351d1adcb18611ce.png)

2. Add a Data Processing node:

   - Connect it to the Message source.

   - Get the device ID from the message payload.

     ![Add a Data Processing node](https://assets.emqx.com/images/c1babb55148d8c38ea783c2d563bfa80.png)

3. Add two HTTP Server nodes as Sinks, both connected to the Data Processing node:

   a. First HTTP Server (check_device_status):

   - Action: check_device_status

   - Connector: RAG_Server

   - URL Path: /chat

   - Method: POST

   - Body:

     ```json
     {
       "query": "Provide a concise status update for device ${device_id}",
       "system_template": "You are an AI assistant for a smart factory..."
     }
     ```

   b. Second HTTP Server (data_trends):

   - Action: data_trends

   - Connector: RAG_Server

   - URL Path: /chat

   - Method: POST

   - Body:

     ```json
     {
       "query": "Predict future trends for device ${device_id} based on its historical data",
       "system_template": "You are an AI assistant for a smart factory..."
     }
     ```

     

![Flows](https://assets.emqx.com/images/e0e4acb64e55c22fe51d9e3e6538fe9b.png)

This flow enhances device querying by incorporating **custom-built prompts**. It listens on the "query/#" topic, extracts the device_id, and sends requests to the RAG server. The key feature is the ability to construct tailored **prompts** within the flow's HTTP Server sinks. Combining the extracted device_id with predefined templates, these custom prompts guide the LLM in generating specific, context-aware responses. This approach allows for flexible, targeted queries about device status and future trends, leveraging the power of GenAI to provide insightful analysis based on data from the vector database.

### Testing EMQX + RAG Server System

Following the above steps, we have set up our EMQX + RAG Server system. This system allows us to store device data in a vector database and query it using natural language, leveraging the power of Large Language Models.

![EMQX + RAG Server system](https://assets.emqx.com/images/f005616469a1864b52d9391dbbdbaff2.png)

#### Step 1: Sending Test Data

First, we'll use MQTTX to send test data to the "factory" topic. This data will be stored in our vector database. Here's an example of the data we'll send:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "DEV6a_2",
  "timestamp": 1723191649992,
  "status": "maintenance",
  "maintenance": {
    "last": "2024-07-26T18:57:44.151Z",
    "next_scheduled": "2024-08-23T22:08:34.408Z"
  },
  "data": {
    "temperature": 76.6,
    "vibration": 2.24,
    "energy_consumption": 148.3,
    "production_data": {
      "rate": 10,
      "total_produced": 469
    },
    "quality_data": {
      "pass_rate": 0.92
    }
  },
  "log": "Scheduled maintenance in progress. Last recorded stats - Temperature: 76.6°C, Vibration: 2.24g. Next scheduled maintenance: 2024-08-23T22:08:34.408Z"
}
```

Send this data to the "factory" topic using MQTTX. You can send multiple messages with varied data to populate the vector database with various device states and readings.

![MQTTX](https://assets.emqx.com/images/009b3d4756d42039ff823bf66e3ebcc4.png)

#### Step 2: Querying Device Status

Next, we'll query the system for device status and predictions. To do this, send a message to the "query" topic with the device ID as the payload. For example:

```json
Topic: query/device_status
Payload: {
  "device_id": "DEV6a_2"
}
```

![Querying Device Status](https://assets.emqx.com/images/7bdf91ad2887bdd739bf2978bb12b114.png)

#### Step 3: Analyzing Results

After sending the query, check the console output or create a web UI showing the result. You should see two responses:

1. A device status analysis provides a summary of the current state of the device.

   ![device status analysis](https://assets.emqx.com/images/4dd47e768b3734b6c7816622b193d1a3.png)

   By comparing it with the last piece of real data, we found that the content in the device status report is completely correct. Convert complex and difficult-to-understand data structures into a more readable format using units, custom value conversions, etc.

1. A data prediction, offering insights into potential future trends based on historical data.

   ![image.png](https://assets.emqx.com/images/42465f144db05b49ca5e5bc39e6a251a.png)

This section offers insights into potential future trends based on historical data. For example, the temperature is expected to stabilize around 60-70°C during normal operations, with high confidence. Vibration and energy consumption are also analyzed, with predictions indicating that vibration will likely stay below 6g during normal operations, and energy consumption will average around 300 units.

These predictions are generated using the stored vector data combined with the LLM, showcasing the system's capability to effectively forecast future conditions and trends.

These responses demonstrate how our system uses the stored vector data in combination with the LLM to generate meaningful insights.

### Further Expansions

To further enhance the system, consider forwarding results to specific MQTT topics, developing a user-friendly web interface, and implementing periodic automatic queries. These improvements would create a more comprehensive IoT monitoring and prediction solution, maximizing the potential of EMQX and GenAI integration.

## Challenges, Opportunities, and Future Potential
