## What is Edge Computing

Enterprise infrastructures continue to evolve â€” more cloud, more devices attaching to the network and more requirements at the edge. This is driving the fast market growth for edge computing. According to [Global Data](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/edge-computing-market-analysis/), the edge computing market was valued at $14.1 billion in 2023 and will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.4% over the forecast period until 2029.

Edge computing represents a cutting-edge computing model that involves processing data in close proximity to its source. This approach allows for swift and extensive data processing, ultimately delivering actionable outcomes in real time.

The term "edge" may refer to different types of edges. It could be the offsite regional edge, onsite compute edge, or gateway and device edge. Generally, the closer the edge, the lower the latency but also the more constrained the resources. Real-time edge computing often occurs at the near edge or even at the device edge.

## Why Edge Computing Matters

Edge computing has become increasingly vital for enterprises seeking to process and store substantial quantities of data locally, as opposed to within their centralized corporate clouds or public clouds. This shift is motivated by the need for reduced latency, improved security, and enhanced cost-efficiency.

### Low Latency

Edge computing allows businesses to process data quickly and reliably without relying on centralized cloud and data center infrastructure. This means that data can be processed in real time or close to real time. For example, imagine the potential issues that can arise when trying to send information from thousands of sensors, cameras, or other devices to a single central location all at once, such as data delays, network congestion, and decreased data quality. Edge computing addresses these challenges by allowing devices to immediately alert key personnel and machines about issues like mechanical problems or security breaches. This enables prompt responses to urgent events.

### Security

Organizations must comply with the data privacy laws of the jurisdiction in which they collect or store customer data. For example, they must adhere to the stringent requirements of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Transferring data to the cloud or a central data center across international borders can complicate compliance with data sovereignty mandates. However, edge computing offers a solution by enabling companies to process and store data locally, in close proximity to where it was originally gathered, thereby upholding local data sovereignty standards.

### Cost-Efficiency

By swiftly processing substantial amounts of data at the local collection points and only delivering useful data to the cloud, edge computing is more efficient than dispatching the entire dataset to a remote centralized cloud. It also conserves bandwidth and cuts costs significantly.

## Challenges of Edge Computing

Although edge computing offers numerous advantages to organizations handling substantial data from edge devices, it also introduces some challenges associated with this architectural approach.

### Real-Time Processing

Many applications, especially in industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles, require immediate responses to data inputs. Real-time processing at the edge reduces the latency that would be introduced by sending data to a centralized cloud. Due to the big data volume but relatively small resources, it is a big challenge for the edge application to process in real-time. An edge stream processing engine is required to achieve real-time analytics. To achieve end-to-end low latency processing, it also requires a real-time communication protocol between edge devices and edge-cloud communication.

### Resource Efficiency

Edge devices operate with limited processing power, memory, and storage capacities. This constraint is often seen as a benefit because it helps to reduce energy consumption, especially for battery-powered devices. However, it also presents a major challenge in edge computing. When deploying applications and services, additional computational resources may be required to meet the demands of these deployments.

A lightweight stream processing engine will facilitate leveraging the resource efficiently. Another approach is to leverage edge cloud collaboration by preprocessing data at the edge and loading tasks that require more resources for edge devices into the cloud. This will require a lightweight communication protocol between the edge and cloud.

### Inter-Operation between Edge Devices

Inter-device communication and interoperability also pose significant challenges. A variety of edge devices, platforms, and communication protocols must collaborate effectively to ensure the success of edge computing implementations. However, achieving seamless interaction among these diverse components is often complex.

### **Reliable Edge-Cloud Communication**

The strengths and weaknesses of edge computing and cloud computing make it necessary to weigh trade-offs when deploying them for specific applications. Instead of being viewed as an alternative to cloud computing, edge computing should be seen as a complement to it. Therefore, edge-cloud collaboration is a common paradigm for achieving business goals. However, the network connection between the edge and the cloud is often fragile, which creates a challenge in maintaining data integrity through reliable communication.

### Management of Large-Scale Edge Nodes

When used in smart vehicles, edge computing instances need to be deployed in each vehicle, which can be challenging to manage due to weak network connections and rapid business changes. A flexible compute engine and reliable control communication channel are essential for managing edge nodes.

## Integrating MQTT with Edge Computing

As a lightweight communication protocol, MQTT plays a key role in edge computing in order to address those challenges.

### Introduction to MQTT

[MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed with an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging model, making it ideal for connecting IoT devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth and exchanging data in real-time between connected devices and cloud services.

MQTT is today widely used in IoT, [Industrial IoT (IIoT)](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/iiot-explained-examples-technologies-benefits-and-challenges), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and [Connected Cars](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/connected-cars-and-automotive-connectivity-all-you-need-to-know), as well as in a wide variety of industries such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation and logistics, and oil and gas.

### Benefits of Integrating MQTT with Edge Computing

The following benefits of MQTT can help address or mitigate the challenges in edge computing.

#### Real-Time

MQTT protocol is optimized for low latency, ensuring that messages are delivered quickly from the publisher to the subscriber. This is essential for applications that require immediate response to data changes.

Additionally, MQTT operates on an asynchronous communication model, which means that it can handle multiple messages simultaneously without waiting for a response to each message. This allows for faster processing and real-time performance.

#### Resource-Efficient

MQTT is engineered for efficient data transfer, employing a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging system to minimize the overhead associated with data transmission. This is accomplished through the use of a small header size and support for data compression, which effectively reduces the volume of data requiring transmission.

#### Interoperability

MQTT is an open messaging protocol allowing devices from different manufacturers to communicate using a common language. It is highly scalable, handling a large number of clients and messages, making it suitable for real-time applications with many simultaneous users or devices.

#### Reliability

MQTT provides a Quality of Service (QoS) feature that ensures messages are delivered with the required reliability. The QoS levels range from 0 (at most once) to 2 (exactly once), allowing applications to choose the appropriate level of message delivery assurance.

MQTT includes mechanisms for maintaining a persistent connection even in the face of intermittent network connectivity. This ensures that messages can be delivered as soon as the connection is reestablished, maintaining real-time performance.
