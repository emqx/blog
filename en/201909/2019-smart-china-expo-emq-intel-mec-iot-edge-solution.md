The 2019 China International Intelligence Industry Expo (hereinafter referred to as the 2019 Intelligence Expo) was held in Chongqing International Expo Center from August 26 to 29, 2019. At the invitation of the Organizing Committee of the  Expo, Intel  Corporation attended the exhibition and created the "Intel Intelligence Innovation Zone".

Intel Intelligence Innovation Zone relies on Chongqing Intelligence Expo to bring together op science and technology innovation projects, show cutting-edge technology applications and create intelligent and diversified intelligent future scenarios and communities. Notably, the "Intel Intelligence Innovation Zone" shows the EMQ IoT MEC edge device access and management platform.

## EMQ  Company Profile

EMQ(https://www.emqx.com/en) is an open source software company providing messaging and streaming engine for IoT market in 5G Era. In 2013, EMQ was released as an open source project on Github (https://github.com/emqx), and subsequently developed into an open source MQTT broker widely used in the global market. In 2017, driven by the rapid growth of customer demand, the company entered into commercial operation and launched EMQX commercial products to speed up the product deployment and application of open source projects and provide professional technical support and services for large enterprise customers. At present, EMQX has more than 5,000 customers worldwide, including dozens of top 500 companies.

## EMQ MEC Edge Access Solution

For the Iot In the 5G era, MEC (Multiple Access Edge Computing) technology is the main service bearer architecture. In the scenario of ultra-low latency and massive device access services, the need for local processing of services close to the location of users and data is becoming more and more obvious. How to quickly realize service access oat the edge of dynamic user needs and transfer business data reliably and efficiently to application modules for processing is the primary problem for MEC in architecture design and application deployment. 

At 2019 Intelligence Expo, EMQ showed the ability to implement IoT edge cloud device access and edge-end streaming data in the edge cloud virtualization environment provided by the IntelÂ® Xeon processor's MEC system. EMQX Cloud-edge integrated solution based on IOT protocol such as MQTT can realize unified remote management and scheduling of edge nodes through cloud management platform, providing access and data processing service capabilities for massive IoT access and high-reliability low-latency connection scenarios in 5G era. .

EMQX Edge can access all kinds of devices at the edge end through industrial protocols such as MQTT, MQTT-SN and [Modbus](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/building-modbus-based-iiot-app-with-neuron), and realize edge processing and storage of data through the stream data processing engine and edge computing nodes at the edge. The control platform at the cloud remotely monitor and schedule the distributed edge nodes through MQTT or HTTP protocol, and push the edge computing service code such as data flow processing rules to the edge end through the cloud management platform to realize cloud-edge integrated management.

EMQ's innovative MEC solution is designed for ultra-low latency, large-scale access and high throughput application in 5G era. It provides MEC software layer infrastructure and application enabling functions to telecom operators, MEC equipment manufacturers, 5G application enterprises, etc. The solution can realize the secure access of local multi-modality and multi-protocol IoT terminals, filter, aggregate and cache the access terminal data, and then push the data to local and remote storage and application modules according to data processing rules. The whole solution is based on the edge-type container architecture, with completely open management and control interface, and can be integrated with cloud-based unified resource scheduling system and network slicing system.
